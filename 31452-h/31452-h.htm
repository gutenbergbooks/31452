<h1>ROY BLAKELEY IN THE HAUNTED CAMP</h1>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE HOUSE IN THE LANE</span></h2>

<p>One fine day in the merry month of August when the birds were singing in the
trees and all the schools were closed and hikes and camping and ice cream cones
were in season, and the chickens were congregated on the platform of the
Hicksville, North Carolina, post office, something of far reaching consequence
happened.</p>

<p>On that day Joshua Hicks, postmaster-general of that thriving world centre,
emerged from the post office, adjusted his octagon-shaped, steel-rimmed
spectacles exactly half way down his long nose, held a certain large envelope at
arm&#8217;s length and contemplating it with an air of rueful perplexity
said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;by&#8211;gum!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>Then he cocked his
head to one side, then to the other, squinted first his right eye, then his
left, and at last inquired, of the chickens, apparently,</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;in&#8211;all&#8211;<i>cre-a-tion</i> is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chickens did not answer him; on the contrary they departed from the
platform, seeing, perhaps, that there was no mail for them. With the exception
of two persons the chickens were the only creatures that ever waited for the
mail in Hicksville.</p>

<p>In the peacefulness of the Hicksville solitude the train could be heard
rattling over the bridge and into the woods beyond, going straight about its
business as if Hicksville did not exist.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Joshua Hicks was astonished, for things like this did
not happen in Hicksville every day. The last previous event had been a circus
but that was nothing compared to the large envelope. For the address on this was
as follows:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>To a lady in Hicksville, North Carolina, who lives in a white house with the
end of the porch broken and with a dog that has a collar. Maybe there&#8217;s a
window broken.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>In the upper left
hand corner was written:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>If not delivered sometime or other return to W. Harris, scout, Raven Patrol
1st Bridgeboro New Jersey troop, Boy Scouts of America.</p> </div><!-- block
quote -->

<p>And at the lower right hand corner was the additional information:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>P. S. There is a puddle outside the woodshed or a pail.</p> </div><!-- block
quote -->

<p>With such detailed information as this Uncle Sam, that world renowned errand
boy, could hardly do otherwise than deliver this formidable document. And thus
it was that W. Harris, scout, had stopped a great train, which goes to show you
what boy scouts can do.</p>

<p>Thinking no doubt that an envelope of such imposing dimensions containing
such explicit descriptive matter was entitled to the honor of rural free
delivery, the postmaster-general himself took off his spectacles, put on a large
straw hat and started up the road.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>He came presently to
a small white house some distance up a lane, where a dog with a collar greeted
him with a cordial wag of the tail.</p>

<p>That dog, in his humble abode, did not know that his fame had gone abroad and
that his personal distinction of a collar was known in the sovereign
commonwealth of New Jersey, not to mention the vast cosmopolitan centre of
Bridgeboro, county seat so-called, because of the comfortable propensity of the
people living there to spend their time sitting down. Perhaps it might more
appropriately have been called the county couch, since the inhabitants were said
to be forever in a kind of doze.</p>

<p>But if Bridgeboro, New Jersey, dozed, Hicksville, North Carolina, had the
sleeping sickness. And it did not even walk in its sleep for not a soul was to
be seen about the little white house nor anywhere else.</p>

<p>There was no doubt, however, of its being the house in question. A pillar at
the end of the porch had rotted away and the roof over the little platform was
tumbling down. A pane of glass was missing from the sitting room window.</p>

<p>But Joshua Hicks was not going to take any <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_5'></a>5</span> chances. So he playfully ruffled the dog&#8217;s hair
to make sure that the collar was around the animal&#8217;s neck and having
satisfied himself of this he strolled around in back of the house for an
official inspection of the puddle or the pail. The United States government must
be very thorough about these things; puddles especially....</p>

<p>There, sure enough, was the puddle, a perennial puddle, fed by a laughing,
babbling, leaky drainpipe. Joshua Hicks dipped a finger in the mud and made sure
of the puddle. He then looked for the pail, and not seeing it, put on his steel
spectacles and glanced again at the envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;A puddle <i>or</i> a pail,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I reckon
that&#8217;s all right; it says <i>or</i> a pail.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was going to knock on the kitchen door, but he bethought him to make a
supplementary inspection of the tumbled down porch roof. There could be no two
opinions about that; even a profiteering landlord would have admitted the
condition. And finally Postmaster Hicks satisfied himself in the best of all
ways of the condition of the window, and that was by cutting his finger on a
fragment of broken glass.</p>

<p>Staunch and true as he was, he was ready to shed his blood for his
country.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN ECHO OF THE WAR</span></h2>

<p>Having satisfied himself beyond all doubt that this little white house was
the proper destination of the letter, Joshua Hicks administered an authoritative
knock on the front door. The response came in the form of a queer little old
lady, who wore a very expectant look, a look almost pathetically expectant. She
was slight and wizened, and stood straight. But her face was deeply wrinkled and
her hair was snowy white.</p>

<p>There was something about her trim, erect little figure and white locks and
furrowed cheeks which aroused sympathy; it would be hard to say why. Perhaps it
was because her brisk little form suggested that she worked hard, and her thin
heavily veined hands and wrinkled face reminded one that she ought not to work
hard. There was a certain something about her which suggested that she was
fighting a brave fight and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_7'></a>7</span> keeping a good heart. At all events she wore a cheery
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joshua,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was kinder hoping to see you over
to-day. It&#8217;s good of you to bring it yourself. I wanted to put my name on
it so&#8217;s you could get me the money in Centerville when you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tain&#8217;t your pension, Mis&#8217; Haskell,&#8221; Joshua said.
&#8220;Leastways, I never seen no pensions come like this before. It&#8217;s
like as if it wuz a letter turned inside out; all the writin&#8217; is on the
outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jes&#8217; when I&#8217;m needing my pension most it don&#8217;t
come,&#8221; she said, taking the big envelope. &#8220;When I saw you prowling
around in back I thought you was the sheriff&#8217;s man, mebbe. It give me a
shock because&#8211;what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask <i>me</i>, Mis&#8217; Haskell,&#8221; said the
postmaster. &#8220;It&#8217;s for you, I&#8217;m certain sure of that, and
that&#8217;s all I can say.&#8221;</p>

<p>With trembling hand and a look of pathetic fear and apprehension, the old
lady started to tear open the envelope, saying the while, &#8220;You don&#8217;t
reckon W. Harris is one of them smart lawyers up New York way, do you, Joshua?
I&#8217;m <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span> ready to get
out when I have to. I&#8217;ve&#8211;I&#8217;ve stuck it out alone, I always
said I could fight, but I can&#8217;t fight the law, Joshua. They don&#8217;t
need to set no lawyers on me&#8211;they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the envelope, and unfolded a sheet of paper. It was old and faded
and wrinkled. She glanced at it, then grasped the door jam with her thin,
trembling hand, as if she feared she might fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tain&#8217;t the law, is it?&#8221; Joshua Hicks inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better be gone, Joshua,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, it ain&#8217;t
the law&#8211;it&#8217;s&#8211;it&#8217;s something else. It ain&#8217;t the
law, Joshua.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it any trouble?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She answered, strangely agitated, &#8220;No, &#8217;tain&#8217;t no trouble,
Joshua.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; to stop sendin&#8217; you your
pension?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as I know of, Joshua, but jes&#8217; I want to be alone. It
ain&#8217;t no trouble of money, Joshua, not this time....&#8221;</p>

<p>If it were no matter of money, then Joshua Hicks could not conjecture what in
the world it was, for there were only two things in old Mrs. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span> Haskell&#8217;s life, and
these were both concerned with money. One was the monthly receipt of her
pension, for in her small way she had helped to make the world safe for
democracy and all that sort of thing. The other was the mortgage and interest on
her little home which the pension could not begin to take care of. Mrs. Haskell
did not understand about this mortgage at all, but the most important part of it
she did understand, and that was that pretty soon she was going to be put out.
She did not have to be a financier or a lawyer to understand that. She had tried
to beat this mortgage back by sewing and gardening and selling eggs, but the
interest had grown faster than the potatoes, the pen was mightier than the
needle and the mortgage had kept right on working while the chickens had taken a
vacation.</p>

<p>The mortgage had beaten poor old Mrs. Haskell at every turn. It had bombarded
her with notices and writs and summonses and things and she had lost the fight.
She had a sort of armistice with this mortgage, but she knew there could be but
one end to that armistice. The little <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_10'></a>10</span> war, a very heroic little war, was as good as over.
The little white house had been made safe for the Liberty Realty Company.</p>

<p>For one brief, terrible moment, before the postmaster had departed, Mrs.
Haskell had feared that perhaps she had done something lawless in connection
with her little pension, signed her name in the wrong place perhaps, and that W.
Harris with all his high sounding names, was some doughty governmental minion
coming to apprehend her in true military fashion. But if the paper contained in
the envelope dispelled that fear, at least it did not cheer her.</p>

<p>She returned into the house, her eyes brimming, the paper shaking in her poor
old hand. She groped her way to an old haircloth armchair in her sitting room,
and put on her spectacles. The moisture from her eyes dimmed the glasses and she
had to take them off and wipe them before beginning to read.</p>

<p>She was quite alone in her little castle, or rather the Liberty Realty
Company&#8217;s little castle. She wanted to be alone. It was very quiet.
Outside the birds could be heard twittering in the vine on the ramshackle little
porch. The kettle sang <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_11'></a>11</span> cheerily in the kitchen. There was that musty indoor
odor of the country homestead, the odor which soldier boys remembered and longed
for in trenches and dugouts. And mingling with this was the fragrance of flowers
coming in through the open window. The dog with a collar strolled in, laid his
head in the old lady&#8217;s lap, looked up into her eyes and listened. There
were only those two there, so she read the contents of the paper aloud.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p><i>Dear Old Mother:</i></p>

<p>I was hoping I might get down to Hicksville before we sail, but guess I
can&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t tell us much here but it seems to be in the air
that we&#8217;ll sail in a day or two. Feeling pretty disappointed because I
wanted to see you again and say good-bye and have just one good home-cooked
meal. I&#8217;m sick of beans and black coffee. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll
hear from me in France. I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll be able to get the
end of the porch fixed up, but try to get the window put in before winter. I
meant to do that myself. Put a pail under the drain so the water won&#8217;t
flood under the woodshed. Tell Don to be a good watch dog and be sure to tie him
outside at night.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll hear from me again till we get across.
Don&#8217;t worry, pretty soon it will all be over and I&#8217;ll come marching
home and you&#8217;ll be telling people it was me that won the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>war and I&#8217;ll be glad
to get a good squint at my old N. C. hills. It will be over before you know it.
Now you have to be brave, see? Just like you were when dad died. Remember what
you said then? Now don&#8217;t think this is good-bye just because I&#8217;m
sailing but remember the Atlantic Ocean isn&#8217;t a one way street. Just chalk
that up on the wall, and speaking about oceans don&#8217;t forget about the
water by the woodshed and do what I told you. So now good-bye dear old Mum and
don&#8217;t worry, and I won&#8217;t go near Paris like you said. Hicksville is
good enough for me.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p class='tar5 sc'>Your loving son.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Haskell read this letter twice. She had to clean her glasses several
times while doing so. Whatever of comfort the letter gave her was expressed in
tears. She arose, a straight, wizened little figure. She went over to an
old-fashioned whatnot which stood in the corner, opened a plush album which lay
there and turned the pages till she came to a certain photograph. This she gazed
at for fully five minutes, the dog standing patiently at her side. Then she took
a postal card which had been laid between the two stiff cardboard leaves. This
also she gazed at though it contained but few words. It bore a date of more than
two years <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span> before.
The printing, with its blank spaces filled, stated that the War Department
regretted to inform her that her son Joseph Haskell had been killed in action on
some date or other in the &#8220;operations&#8221; west of some place or
other.</p>

<p>She stooped down and patted the dog and he held up his head against the
almost threadbare material of her poor gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did write after&#8211;all&#8211;he did&#8211;Don,&#8221; she
sobbed. &#8220;He did&#8211;he wrote before he went&#8211;away. I don&#8217;t
know who&#8211;W. Harris&#8211;I don&#8217;t understand it&#8211;but he
<i>did</i> write. See?&#8221; The dog seemed to understand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haskell dried her eyes with her kitchen apron, folded the letter, laid
it with the post card, took a final pensive look at the photograph and clasped
the heavy plush covers over all three. Then she sat down by the window and
patted the dog with one thin hand while with the other she lifted the kitchen
apron again to those poor old eyes. Thus they sat silently.</p>

<p>It was just an echo, a faint, belated echo of the great war....</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</span></h2>

<p>To know something of the circumstances which caused this letter to reach Mrs.
Haskell like a ghost out of the past, we shall have to betake ourselves to
Bennett&#8217;s Fresh Confectionery and Ice Cream Parlor on Main Street in
Bridgeboro, New Jersey. And that is by no means a bad sort of place to begin,
for Bennett had the genial habit of filling an ice cream cone so that the cream
stood up on top like the dome on the court house in Bridgeboro, and extended
down into the apex, packed tight and hard.</p>

<p>It was long before the great sensation in Hicksville, and on a certain
pleasant day early in vacation, that Roy Blakeley, leader of the Silver Fox
Patrol, and several scouts of the First Bridgeboro Troop were lined up along
Bennett&#8217;s counter partaking of refreshment. To be exact, they had finished
and were waiting for Walter, alias <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_15'></a>15</span> Pee-wee Harris to finish, for Pee-wee had the true
scout thoroughness and went down to the very bottom of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it you boys aren&#8217;t off camping this summer?&#8221; Mr.
Bennett asked sociably, as he leaned against the fixtures behind the
counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should worry about camp this year,&#8221; Roy said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been fixing up our old railroad car for a meeting-place down
by the river and we&#8217;re going to stay home and earn some money to buy a
rowboat and a canoe and start a kind of a camp of our own down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to build a float,&#8221; Pee-wee said, digging with
his spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and a sink,&#8221; Roy said, &#8220;so we can wash our hands of
Bridgeboro. We&#8217;ll be dead to the world down there. We&#8217;re going to
lead the simple life like a lot of simps. We&#8217;re going to catch salt fish
in the salt marshes and everything. All we need is a treasury; you didn&#8217;t
happen to see one around anywhere, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I should happen to see a treasury I&#8217;ll let you know,&#8221;
Mr. Bennett laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need a standing capital,&#8221; said Artie Van Arlen, leader of the
Ravens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>&#8220;We
wouldn&#8217;t care if it was lying down as long as we had it,&#8221; Roy
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d like some assessments,&#8221; Pee-wee said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean assets,&#8221; Doc Carson laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same only different,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we want is a few standing capitals, and some small letters and a
couple of surpluses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deficits are good; did you ever hear of those?&#8221; Pee-wee
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need about eighty-five cents and fifty dollars,&#8221; Roy said.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll start a drive only we haven&#8217;t got any horse.
Maybe we can catch some goldfish down there and sell them for old gold. We
should worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bennett said, &#8220;Well now, you scouts ought to be able to raise some
funds. You seem to raise pretty nearly everything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We raise the dickens,&#8221; Grove Bronson said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to sell some stock,&#8221; Roy said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got some rolling stock down there&#8211;one car. Only it
doesn&#8217;t roll. Who wants to buy some stock in the Riverside Scout Camp?
Watered stock, we dip it in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what watered stock is; you&#8217;re so
smart,&#8221; Pee-wee sneered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>&#8220;Sure,
it&#8217;s milk,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;Right the first time, no sooner said
than stung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never laugh at poverty,&#8221; Westy said, as all the party began to
shout. &#8220;We&#8217;re poor but dishonest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Roy ejaculated, &#8220;we wouldn&#8217;t even steal a
cent, that&#8217;s why we haven&#8217;t any sense; deny it if you
dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can sell papers at the station,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;We can
do golden deeds and get gold that way. We should bother our young lives. What
care us, quoth we? We&#8217;ll think of a way. All we need is fifty dollars to
put tar-paper on the roof and a new cook stove in the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money talks,&#8221; the kid shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night!&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;then we don&#8217;t want any of
it. You do enough talking in this troop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you fellows all one outfit?&#8221; asked a young man who had been
leaning against the opposite counter, amused at their talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;United we stand, divided we sprawl,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;There are
more of us, too, only they&#8217;re not here. They&#8217;re by the
river.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>&#8220;I can give
you a chance to earn some money if you really want to,&#8221; the young man
said. &#8220;Do you think you could stick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our middle name is fly-paper,&#8221; Roy informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like camping?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Camping is named after us,&#8221; Connie Bennett of the Elk Patrol
said. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather camp than eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No we wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; vociferated Pee-wee Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of hours?&#8221; Doc Carson of the Ravens inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The usual kind,&#8221; Roy volunteered, and put it up to their new
friend if this were not so. &#8220;The same kind we use in school, hey?&#8221;
he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him a chance to tell us what it is,&#8221; said Westy Martin of
Roy&#8217;s patrol. &#8220;We all started saying we&#8217;d like to earn some
money; talk is cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s why we use so much of it,&#8221; said Roy.
&#8220;If it cost anything we couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the young man, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a job and I
need help. It&#8217;s outdoors and it means camping and living rough. It means
cooking our <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span> own
meals. You could get a little money out of it; not much, but a
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was what the stranger said, perhaps the way he said it, but
something caused them all to turn and stare at him.</p>

<p>He was a young fellow of about twenty-three or four and of very shabby
appearance. The threadbare suit which he wore must have seen long service and
either it had never been a very trim fit or he had lost flesh. His face, indeed,
seemed to imply this, being thin and pale, and there was a kind of haunting look
in his eyes.</p>

<p>But his demeanor was creditable, he seemed quite free of any taint of the
shiftlessness which his appearance might have suggested, and his amusement at
the scouts&#8217; bantering nonsense was open and pleasant. Mr. Bennett
contemplated him with just a tinge of dubiousness in his look. But the scouts
liked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the nature of the work?&#8221; Mr. Bennett asked.</p>

<p>The young man seemed a trifle uneasy at being directly questioned but no one
would have said it was more than the diffidence which any sensitive young fellow
might show towards strangers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s
taking down two or three buildings,&#8221; he said; &#8220;just shacks. My name
is Blythe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here in town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, up at the old camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean Camp Merritt? I heard the government sold the whole
shebang. What are they doing? Putting gangs to work up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you tear down Camp Merritt!&#8221; Pee-wee
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re just giving the jobs out piecemeal,&#8221; the young
man said amid the general laughter. &#8220;Anybody that wants to tear a building
down can get permission. They give so much a building. I undertook three. If I
could get some help and do it in a month or so I&#8217;d have a little money. I
haven&#8217;t got anybody so far. I suppose that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s out
of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then you don&#8217;t work for the wrecking concern?&#8221; Mr.
Bennett queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that way,&#8221; the stranger said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You belong hereabouts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N&#8211;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody else working up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>&#8220;I suppose
these youngsters could get a commission to haul down several buildings
themselves if they wanted to?&#8221; Mr. Bennett inquired. &#8220;Cut out the
middle man, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young fellow seemed a trifle worried. &#8220;I&#8211;I didn&#8217;t think
of that,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I guess they could. But I don&#8217;t want much
out of it myself,&#8221; he added, in a voice that had almost a note of pleading
in it; &#8220;and I picked out the easiest shacks. They&#8217;d&#8211;I&#8217;d
be willing&#8211;they&#8217;d get most of the money. Beggars can&#8217;t be
choosers. I&#8217;m out of work&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s best for youngsters to have a boss, eh?&#8221; Mr.
Bennett added, genially. &#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;re right. Somebody to
keep them out of mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scouts and their new friend strolled out onto Main Street and, pausing
there in a little group, continued talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think we&#8217;re the kind to get an idea from you and then go
and use it and leave you out, you&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; said Connie
Bennett.</p>

<p>&#8220;The camp isn&#8217;t mine,&#8221; their new friend said,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>&#8220;No, but
that particular job is yours,&#8221; Westy Martin insisted, &#8220;and
we&#8217;re on that job, if we go there at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good argument,&#8221; Pee-wee ejaculated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying up there?&#8221; Connie asked.</p>

<p>The stranger seemed pleased, even relieved. That uncertain, diffident smile
hovered for a moment about his mouth. &#8220;I&#8217;d treat you right,
that&#8217;s sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty hard for a fellow to
get work. I just sort of stumbled into this&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you stumbled into us, too,&#8221; said Roy, a
note of sympathy and sincerity in his voice that there was no mistaking.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to speak to our mothers and fathers, but don&#8217;t you
worry, we have them trained all right. We have cooking outfits and everything,
too. We&#8217;ll take a hike up there to-morrow. We&#8217;d like to make some
money, but gee whiz, that isn&#8217;t the only thing we care about. Camping and
all that&#8211;that&#8217;s what we like. Don&#8217;t we, Westy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can we find you up there?&#8221; Westy asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>&#8220;You go up
the Knickerbocker Road and right in through the old entrance,&#8221; Blythe
said. &#8220;The second shack you come to on your left is where I&#8217;m
bunking. You&#8217;ll see me around somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do your own cooking?&#8221; Artie Van Arlen asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&#8217;m not much of a cook,&#8221; Blythe said.
&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t&#8211;I won&#8217;t get anything till the
work&#8217;s finished&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should worry about that,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I can eat most anything,&#8221; Blythe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you eat as many as eleven?&#8221; Pee-wee laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you eat as many as eleven?&#8221; Pee-wee demanded.</p>

<p>That same elusive, half-bashful, pleasant smile lingered on the
stranger&#8217;s lips again as he said, &#8220;&#8211;I
guess&#8211;not&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I can beat you,&#8221; Pee-wee announced conclusively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes the bus,&#8221; Westy said. &#8220;Do you go up in
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll walk,&#8221; Blythe said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll be up there to-morrow, sure,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span> Doc Carson reassured him;
&#8220;some of us anyway. Even if we don&#8217;t come to stay we&#8217;ll be up
there, so you look for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fair and square,&#8221; Blythe said. &#8220;When you come
you can look the place over and then say&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should worry about that,&#8221; Roy interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe your people&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You leave our people to us,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;My father believes
in camping and fun&#8211;he inherits that from me. Scouts know how to pick out
fathers all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their new friend smiled again, with a kind of simple pleasure at Roy&#8217;s
nonsense, &#8220;I&#8217;ll look for you,&#8221; he said. Then they parted.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got some walk all the way up to Camp Merritt,&#8221; Doc
Carson said. &#8220;Do you suppose he hasn&#8217;t any money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks that way,&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kind of like him,&#8221; Doc said. &#8220;I guess he&#8217;s in hard
luck all right. I&#8217;m glad we met him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one that did it,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say for us all to go into Bennett&#8217;s? Now you
see!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;All we have
to do is to follow you,&#8221; Roy said, &#8220;and adventures come around
wanting to eat out of our hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8211;I&#8217;m the one to show you where there&#8217;s money
too,&#8221; Pee-wee said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a capital or whatever you call
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the smallest capital <i>I</i> ever saw,&#8221; Roy
said.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PEE-WEE FIXES IT</span></h2>

<p>The concerted assault which the scouts made upon their parents for permission
to proceed with their plan ended in a compromise. Late that same afternoon Mr.
Ellsworth, scoutmaster of the troop, drove up to the old camp in his auto and
looked over the situation. He talked with Blythe also and was evidently not
unfavorably impressed, for he returned to Bridgeboro quite converted to the
enterprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer kind of a duck,&#8221; he said to Mr. Blakeley,
referring to Blythe. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s out of luck and rather
discouraged. He doesn&#8217;t say much. I think he took this job in desperation
not knowing exactly how he was going to go ahead with it. He expects to get
three hundred dollars for what he&#8217;s undertaken. He means to divide evenly,
he said, but of course that will leave him with only twelve dollars, if the
whole troop goes <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span> up.
He doesn&#8217;t seem to have any grasp of things at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I proposed to him that he keep one hundred dollars for himself and
give the boys the other two hundred. This fellow has lost his grip and I doubt
if he&#8217;ll do much work, but of course it&#8217;s his job. It&#8217;s as
much to help him as anything else that I&#8217;d like to see the troop go up
there. It ought to be fun camping in the ramshackle old place; I&#8217;d rather
like it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This Blythe, he doesn&#8217;t belong around these parts, does
he?&#8221; Mr. Blakeley asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I believe not, but I think he&#8217;s all right. I size him up for
a disheartened member of the big army of unemployed who stumbled on this
opportunity. He has a look in his eyes that goes to my heart. He needs to be
out-of-doors, that&#8217;s sure. If the troop doesn&#8217;t give him a hand
he&#8217;ll have to pass it up. The boys want a little money and here&#8217;s a
good chance to earn it and do a good turn at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You liked him, eh?&#8221; Mr. Blakeley asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, on the whole I did. He&#8217;s an odd case and I can&#8217;t
altogether make him out, but I liked him. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s very
well, for one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>&#8220;Well I
guess it&#8217;s a good chance for the boys,&#8221; Mr. Blakeley said.</p>

<p>That, indeed, was the consensus of opinion of the men higher up and there was
another demonstration of the remarkable power which the scouts had over their
parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know how to manage them all right,&#8221; said Pee-wee to Roy.
&#8220;I told your father I&#8217;d see that you got back all safe; I told him
to leave it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pee-wee&#8217;s responsibilities, according to his own account, were many and
various. He promised Doc Carson&#8217;s mother that he would personally see to
it that Doc wore his sweater at night. He gave his word to Mr. Hollister that
Warde would not over-eat&#8211;Pee-wee was an authority on that subject. He
distributed his promises and undertook obligation with a generosity that only a
boy scout can show. He advised Mrs. Benton, Dorry&#8217;s mother, not to worry,
that her son should be the subject of his especial care.</p>

<p>He magnanimously volunteered to be responsible for the safety of the whole
troop. And he announced that Mr. Ellsworth&#8217;s judgment was the same as his
own precisely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>With such
assurances the troops&#8217; parents could not do otherwise than surrender
unconditionally, and Pee-wee of the Ravens was the hero, the George Washington,
of the expedition.</p>

<p>At all events he carried his little hatchet with him, and it pulled on his
belt so that he had to be continually hoisting it up and tightening his belt so
that before the expeditionary forces had gone far he looked not unlike a bolster
tied in the middle.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>PEE-WEE&#8217;S DISCOVERY</span></h2>

<p>The next morning the troop started on their hike to the old camp. Excepting
their tents they carried full camping equipment, blankets, cooking utensils,
first aid kit, lanterns, changes of clothing, and plenty of those materials
which Roy&#8217;s magic could conjure into luscious edibles. The raw material
for the delectable flipflop was there, cans groaning with egg-powder, raisins
for plum-duff, savory bacon, rice enough for twenty weddings and chocolate
enough to corner the market in chocolate sundaes. Cans of exasperated milk, as
Pee-wee called it, swelled his duffel bag, and salt and pepper he also carried
because, as Roy said, he was both fresh and full of pep. Carrots for
hunter&#8217;s stew were carried by the Elks because red was their patrol color.
A can of lard dangled from the end of Dorry Benton&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> scout staff. Beans were the especial
charge of Warde Hollister because he had come from Boston.</p>

<p>Most of the scouts had visited Camp Merritt during the war when it was
seething with activity, and when watchful sentinels stood on every road of
approach, challenging the visitor and demanding to see his pass. They had been
familiar with the boys in khaki, strangers in New Jersey mostly, who filled the
streets of Bridgeboro. But they had not visited the old camp since it had become
a deserted village.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to them that the place which had so lately swarmed with
life, and had a sort of flaunting air of martial energy and preparation, should
have become the lonely biding place of one poor soul and that its only service
now was to stand between that poor stricken derelict and starvation.</p>

<p>If they had taken their way up the Knickerbocker Road along which auto
parties and pedestrians had once thronged to see the soldiers, they would have
found the going easy, but instead they followed the river northward, for five or
six miles, then cut through the country eastward which <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span> would bring them to the western extremity
of the old camp.</p>

<p>In this last part of their journey they fell into an indistinct trail, much
overgrown, running through an area of comparatively wild country. This, indeed,
had been a beaten path between the camp and the villages to the west. It had
known the tread of many an A. W. O. L.<a id='FNanchor_1'></a><a
href='#Footnote_1' class='fnanchor'><sup>[1]</sup></a> soldier, yet it had not
been altogether a secret path, but rather one of convenience. At all events it
had been well clear of the main entrance on the Knickerbocker Road, and this
conspicuous advantage had given it a certain popularity.</p>

<p>At the time of the boys&#8217; journey this path would probably have been
indistinguishable to any but scouts. It brought them soon to an old tumbled-down
building which had never been more than a mere shack, and was now so utterly
dilapidated that living in it would be quite out of the question. Some remnants
of a roof remained in a few shreds of curled, rotten shingles, the foundation
was intact, and the sides though bulging and full of gaping crevices were still
standing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>&#8220;Oh look at
the house, it&#8217;s all ruined like Reims Cathedral,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted.
This, indeed, was its only point of resemblance to Reims Cathedral. &#8220;Come
on inside,&#8221; he continued, leading the way, &#8220;it&#8217;s a dandy
place, it&#8217;s all caving in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they want about a thousand dollars a month rent for this
place,&#8221; said Westy Martin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;it has all modern improvements, free
shower-baths when it rains and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within, the place was dank and musty and cobwebs spread across the openings
where the windows had been. Much broken glass and a couple of sash weights
fastened to ends of rotten sash cord lay upon the floor. In the corner was a
makeshift bed of straw, matted from age, damp and unwholesome. The place was in
possession of spiders. Whole boards of the flooring had rotted, yielding like
mud under the feet of the scouts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some place,&#8221; said Connie Bennett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, here&#8217;s a dime,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted reaching under an open
space in the flooring. &#8220;I can get a soda with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s another,&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>It seemed likely
that some of the heroes who had made the world safe for democracy had beguiled
their time playing craps before going forth to glory.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pee-wee shouted, &#8220;Oh look at this! I bet it has something to
do with a spy! I bet it has secret papers in it! <i>Look what I
found!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>From under the edge of the rotten straw our observant young hero had pulled
out an oilskin wallet. There were not many such places as this old ruin that did
not yield up their treasures to Pee-wee. The veriest ash heap became a place of
romance under his prying hand and inquisitive eye. This find was just one of
those ordinary oilskin wallets which had held and protected many letters from
mothers and sweethearts and which had been shot through and through in the
trenches in France. Black spots of mildew were upon it and it had an oily,
unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I found it! I found it!</i>&#8221; Pee-wee vociferated, as the
scouts all clustered about him eager to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the greatest discoverer next to Christopher
Columbus,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s inside
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say to stop here?&#8221; Pee-wee
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never thought you&#8217;d find an ice cream soda here,&#8221; Roy
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never know where you&#8217;ll find one,&#8221; Pee-wee said in
high excitement. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I find a dime in a sewer-pipe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice place to find a soda,&#8221; Roy laughed.
&#8220;Open the wallet and let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pressing about Pee-wee, the scouts read eagerly the contents of that old
musty oilskin memento of the days when Camp Merritt was a seething community of
boys in khaki. The big spiders lurked in their webs; the repulsive little slugs,
made homeless by the lifting of a damp, rotten board, hurried frantically about
on the floor; a single ray of sunlight penetrated through a crevice, a slanting,
dusty line, and lit up a little area of the dim, musty place. But there was no
sound, not even from the scouts, save only the voice of Westy Martin as he read
that old, creased, damp, all but undecipherable letter:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p><i>Dear Old Mother:</i></p>

<p>I was hoping I might get down to Hicksville before we sail, but I guess I
can&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t tell us much here but it seems to be in the air
that we&#8217;ll sail in a day or two. Feeling pretty <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>disappointed because I wanted to see you
again and say good-bye and have just one good home-cooked meal. I&#8217;m sick
of beans and black coffee. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll hear from me in
France. I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll be able to get the end of the porch
fixed up, but try to get the window put in before winter. I meant to do that
myself. Put a pail under the drain so the water won&#8217;t flood under the
woodshed. Tell Don to be a good watch dog and be sure to tie him outside at
night.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll hear from me again till we get across.
Don&#8217;t worry, pretty soon it will all be over and I&#8217;ll come marching
home and you&#8217;ll be telling people it was me that won the war and
I&#8217;ll be glad to get a good squint at my old N. C. hills. It will be over
before you know it. Now you have to be brave, see? Just like you were when dad
died. Remember what you said then? Now don&#8217;t think this is good-bye
because I&#8217;m sailing but remember the Atlantic Ocean isn&#8217;t a one way
street. Just chalk that up on the wall, and speaking about oceans don&#8217;t
forget about the water by the woodshed and do what I told you. So now good-bye
dear old Mum and don&#8217;t worry, and I won&#8217;t go near <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>Paris like you said.
Hicksville is good enough for me.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p class='tar5 sc'>Your loving son.</p>

<p>There was something about this old missive which sobered the bantering troop
of scouts and made even Pee-wee quiet and thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a letter he was going to send,&#8221; Artie Van Arlen
finally said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Doc Carson asked.</p>

<p>Artie shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Somebody or other, that&#8217;s all
<i>we</i> know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t even know who he was going
to send it to; there are a whole lot of dear old mothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it,&#8221; commented Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see the other papers,&#8221; one of the scouts said.</p>

<p>The only other contents of the wallet were a small paper with blanks filled
in, and an engraved calling card. The paper with the blanks filled in was so
smeared from long moisture that the written parts were undecipherable. The paper
was evidently a leave of absence from camp. The name was utterly blurred out,
but by studying the smeared writing in the space where the date <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span> had been written the
scouts thought they could determine the date, or at least part of it.
<i>Sun&#8211;1918</i> was all they could be sure of.</p>

<p>But fortunately the calling card appeared to confirm this date. It was a card
of fine quality and beautifully engraved with the name of Helen Shirley Bates.
In the lower left hand corner was engraved Woodcliff, New Jersey. On the back of
the card was written in a free feminine hand <i>For dinner Sunday April 14th,
1918. One o&#8217;clock.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make out of it? What does it mean? Who was he
anyway?&#8221; the scouts, interrupting each other, asked, as these memorials of
an unknown soldier boy were passed around from hand to hand and eagerly
read.</p>

<p>Of all the scouts Westy Martin, of Roy&#8217;s Patrol, was the soberest and
most thoughtful. He had the most balance. Not that Roy did not have balance, but
he never had much on hand because he was continually losing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever he was,&#8221; Westy said, &#8220;it looks as if he got a
leave of absence to go to the girl&#8217;s house for dinner. Going this way
would be a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span> shortcut
to Woodcliff. Maybe he was going to take the train up from New
Milford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he was going to mail the letter to his mother in New Milford,
hey?&#8221; Hunt Ward of the Elks suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but why didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Doc Carson asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery,&#8221; said Pee-wee. &#8220;Do you know what
I&#8217;m going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Break it to us gently,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day soon I&#8217;m going to hike to Woodcliff and see that girl
and find out what that soldier&#8217;s name is and I&#8217;m going to send the
letter to his mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of doing that?&#8221; Vic Norris asked.
&#8220;The soldier has probably been home two years by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Pee-wee insisted; &#8220;the letter is to
his mother and I&#8217;m going to see that she gets it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to get a soda while you&#8217;re up at Woodcliff?&#8221;
Roy asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Pee-wee said with great vehemence;
&#8220;if you got a letter that went astray you&#8217;d want it, wouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking in chunks,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;Go <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span> ahead and see the girl if
you want to. I bet she&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re sweet. Only come ahead and
let&#8217;s get to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unanimously carried by a large majority,&#8221; Dorry Benton said.
&#8220;Mysteries aren&#8217;t going to buy tar-paper for our old car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There might have been a thousand dollars in this wallet,&#8221;
Pee-wee reminded them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except for one thing,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that?&#8221; Pee-wee asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That there wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;Put it in your pocket
and come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though they treated Pee-wee&#8217;s find as something of a joke and attached
no significance to it, still the discovery of these old papers which had now no
meaning for anybody kept recurring to them as they made their way to the old
camp. But the consensus of opinion was that these old mildewed remnants of
another time were unimportant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What good is a letter when the fellow who sent it is already
home?&#8221; Doc Carson asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What use is a leave of absence that expired two or three years
ago?&#8221; Connie Bennett added.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>&#8220;If that
fellow&#8217;s away yet, he&#8217;s overstaying his leave, that&#8217;s
sure,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What good is a Sunday dinner that somebody ate a couple of years
ago?&#8221; Doc queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s up there eating it yet,&#8221; Will Dawson
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way our young hero would do,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say it isn&#8217;t important&#8211;that dinner?&#8221;
Pee-wee demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, all dinners are important,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;But one two
years old isn&#8217;t much good. If it was only six months old I wouldn&#8217;t
say anything, but <i>two years</i>&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy!&#8221; vociferated Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;one dinner is as important as another if
not more so. Deny it if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway I&#8217;m going to see that girl,&#8221; Pee-wee said.</p>

<p>&#8220;At dinnertime?&#8221; Roy asked slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out who that fellow is, I&#8217;ve got his
finger prints here, too, on this card&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;G-o-o-d night,&#8221; laughed Roy. &#8220;The boy scout Sherlock Home
Sweet Holmes. I suppose <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_43'></a>43</span> you&#8217;ll have that poor girl in Atlanta
Penitentiary before you get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see the finger prints?&#8221; Westy asked.</p>

<p>Pee-wee showed him the card and there, sure enough, was a finger print on the
face of it and two on the back. It looked as if someone with greasy hands had
taken the card up as one usually holds a card....</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THEN AND NOW</span></h2>

<p>Within ten or fifteen minutes more they were in the old camp. They entered
the reservation territory at its western edge and cutting across soon came to
the concrete road which runs north and south through the middle of the camp.
This is the Knickerbocker Road which traversed the reservation territory before
ever Camp Merritt was heard of, and bears its scanty traffic now through that
pathetic scene of ruin and desolation. It is the one feature of the camp that
was not of its temporary character.</p>

<p>Up this road through Dumont to the south, there once passed a never ceasing
procession of autos, encountering guards and sentinels for a mile south of the
camp. The atmosphere of military officialdom permeated the public approaches for
miles in both directions.</p>

<p>If one were so fortunate as to have a pass, he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span> could by dint of many stops and absurd
inquiries and parleys, succeed in reaching the large gate posts on which was
printed UNITED STATES RESERVATION. Through this the Knickerbocker Road, being
especially privileged, passed without challenge, straight through the middle of
the camp and out of its northern extremity, then through the pleasant little
town of Haworth.</p>

<p>On either side of this road, within the confines of the camp, were board
shacks of every size and variety. They were for every purpose conceivable and,
large and small, they were all alike in this, that they had a makeshift,
temporary look, and were a delight to the eye of the tried and true camper. They
were all alike in this, too, that civilian patriots had charged twenty dollars a
day to put them up. This was in odd contrast to the one poor, hapless soul who
was to receive three hundred dollars for the work of tearing several of them
down.</p>

<p>As the scouts, his one hope now, came up onto the central road and hiked
southward toward the main entrance, they scrutinized the weather-beaten and
windowless structures on either side for a sign of their friend. But no hint of
any <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> human presence
was there, no suggestion of life of any kind, save a companionable windmill
nearby, the moving wheel of which creaked cheerfully as if to assure these scout
pilgrims that the scene of their destination was not altogether deserted. It
seemed a kind of living, friendly thing, in that forlorn surrounding. What
surging life it had witnessed, what hearty, reckless, resolute departures! One
might fancy it saying as it revolved, &#8220;I have seen all, seen the boys come
and go, and I alone am left in all this hollow desolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys paused a moment to watch this lonely sentinel and listen to its
creaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sound would give me the shudders at night, if I didn&#8217;t know
what caused it,&#8221; one of them said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut your eyes, then listen,&#8221; said Westy. &#8220;It sounds kind
of spooky, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, but this is a lonely place,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;It
reminds you of Broadway, it&#8217;s so different. It&#8217;s a peach of a place
to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet there are ghosts up here,&#8221; Pee-wee said darkly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;Sure,
you&#8217;d better look around for finger prints,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe that old windmill is haunted, hey?&#8221; our young hero
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It needs oil anyway,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me tired,&#8221; said Pee-wee contemptuously. &#8220;A ghost
can squeak, can&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;if it&#8217;s rusty.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for all their banter the old windmill, perhaps because it was the only
thing stirring, held them and sobered their thoughts as it would not have done
elsewhere. Perhaps they felt a sort of consciousness of its lonely position and
fancied it to be something human. It overlooked the obscure path along which
they had come; how many forms in khaki had it seen stealing to or from the camp?
A. W. O. L. How many truckloads of uproarious boys had it seen driven away? How
many maimed and suffering brought back? Surely it had seen much that the most
loyal citizens had not been permitted to see. A whimsical thought, perhaps, but
what good fun it would be to climb up there and learn some dark and tragic
secrets from this lonely old derelict, the only thing with any sign of life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span> that Uncle Sam had
left in that forlorn, deserted spot.</p>

<p>Had it any tragic secret? That seemed quite absurd. A creaky old windmill
revolving to no purpose in that waste, because it had nothing else to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Listen!</i>&#8221; said Pee-wee. &#8220;Sh-h-h! I heard a
noise&#8211;up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captivated for the moment by their own mood, they all paused, listening.
Then, not far off, a friendly voice accosted them. It was young Mr. Blythe
coming to greet them. His face wore that uncertain, hovering smile, which had
the effect of arousing pity. His eyes had an eager, startled look, like those of
a frightened animal. He seemed backward, almost bashful, but his joy at seeing
them was unmistakable and sincere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better late than never,&#8221; laughed Roy. &#8220;Here we are bag and
baggage; we thought you were a spook or something....&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>PEACE!</span></h2>

<p>Blythe was bunking in one of the shacks which he had secured the privilege of
tearing down and it was apparent to the scouts that his knowledge of camping was
primitive. But Pee-wee, out of the greatness of his scout heart, volunteered to
be his guide, philosopher, and friend in these matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll show you how to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
there&#8217;s anything you don&#8217;t understand you just come to me.
I&#8217;ve got the camping badge and the pathfinder&#8217;s badge, and the
astronomer&#8217;s badge&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an astronomer,&#8221; interrupted Roy; &#8220;he knows all
the movie stars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sees everything in the sky,&#8221; Hunt Ward added;
&#8220;he&#8217;s the one that put the see in sea-scout.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;Sure, and
put the pie in pioneer scout too,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;He studied first aid
and last aid and lemonade and everything. He&#8217;s a scout in very high
standing only he doesn&#8217;t stand very high. You stick to him and you
can&#8217;t go wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say I haven&#8217;t the badge for camping?&#8221; the
diminutive Raven demanded as he unburdened himself of his various paraphernalia.
&#8220;Do you mean to say I didn&#8217;t study the heavens when I was a
tenderfoot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder the stars went out,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;Here, take this
bag of flour and put it over in the corner. You&#8217;re in Camp Merritt now,
you have to obey your superior officer. Here, take the spools of thread out of
this coffee-pot and kick that big can over here, the one marked dynamite.
I&#8217;m going to put the sugar in that. Anyone who takes any sugar without
permission will be blown up by his patrol leader. <i>Look what you&#8217;re
doing!</i> Don&#8217;t set the pickles on the chocolate. Hand me that bottle of
ink before you spill it in the egg powder.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was good to see Blythe laughing at Pee-wee&#8217;s heroic effort to
dispose of the commissary stores which his companions loaded upon him. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span> It was a laugh of simple,
genuine pleasure, almost childlike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t drop the fly-paper in the flour,&#8221; Roy shouted to
Pee-wee in frantic warning, as Pee-wee wrestled valiantly under the load of
boxes, packages and cans. &#8220;Put the cork back in the molasses jug before it
spills into the Indian meal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have home brew,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean home glue,&#8221; Roy answered. &#8220;<i>Look at him!</i>
He&#8217;s got the powdered cocoanut all over the bacon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep those things off me!&#8221; the victim shouted as the boxes and
cans piled up on him. &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m a freight car?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As he stooped to pick up a box a can went rolling under Blythe&#8217;s
makeshift bed. As he reached for the can a bag of beans burst like a sky-rocket,
pouring a shower down his neck and into his pockets and over the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Now you see!</i>&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;The eggs are sliding
down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Help, help!</i>&#8221; called several scouts.</p>

<p>Pee-wee picked up two cans of sardines and sacrificed a bag of rice. He
gathered up rice and beans together, and a jar of jam went rolling <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span> on a career of foreign
travel. All was confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Time!</i>&#8221; he screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He asks for an armistice,&#8221; Roy shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean a couple of dozen arms,&#8221; Westy shrieked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you put another thing on me I&#8217;ll drop the eggs,&#8221;
Pee-wee screamed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll drop them so that
they&#8211;they&#8211;<i>bounce</i>, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>This threat of frightfulness cowered his assailants.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s against international law,&#8221; Roy shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; Pee-wee yelled.
&#8220;You pile one more thing on me and I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Start an eggmarine campaign,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the first time I ever knew food to get the best of
Pee-wee,&#8221; Artie Van Arlen observed.</p>

<p>The diminutive mascot of the Raven Patrol having valiantly protected the eggs
in one extended hand gradually divested himself of the mountain under which he
had labored, and by a fine strategic move took a tactical position behind these
defenses with the pasteboard box of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_53'></a>53</span> eggs upraised in heroic and threatening defiance. The
war had come to an end suddenly, like the World War.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unconditional surrender,&#8221; Roy shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I get three helpings of stew for supper?&#8221; demanded the
victor, by way of imposing an indemnity before he proceeded with
disarmament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, eggs won the war,&#8221; Roy conceded.</p>

<p>As for Blythe, he was sitting on a grocery box in No Man&#8217;s Land,
laughing so hard that his sides ached. Their banter seemed a kind of tonic to
him. And it was when he laughed and seemed so simple and childlike and so much
one of them, that they found him so likable.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AROUND THE FIRE</span></h2>

<p>After this decisive conflict the period of reconstruction or rather the
period of demolition, began auspiciously. It began with a grand feast cooked
out-of-doors in the brass kettle which was the pride of Roy&#8217;s life. That
brass kettle stood upon a scout fireplace of stones, and from its interior a
hunter&#8217;s stew diffused its luscious fragrance to those who sat about,
feeding the companionable fire. The scouts were quite masters of the situation,
their coming must have been like a freshening breeze to the lonely visitant at
the old deserted camp, and their fun and brisk efficiency and readiness seemed
to give him a new life and afford him amusement which was expressed in that
silent, likeable, yet haunting smile. It was not often that he laughed aloud and
he talked but little, and then with a kind of diffidence that seemed odd in one
so much their senior.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave that kettle to my ancestors <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span> when I die,&#8221; Roy
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been all over and I&#8217;ve cooked everything in it
except Cook&#8217;s tours; it&#8217;s travelled more than they have, anyway.
It&#8217;s been to Temple Camp and we fished it up from the bottom of the lake
once and I guess as many as ten thousand wheat cakes have come out of that
kettle. Hey, Pee-wee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine thousand eight hundred is all Pee-wee can say for sure
about,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you used to camping?&#8221; Doc Carson asked Blythe. &#8220;I
thought maybe you liked this kind of thing because you came here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just that I was out of a job,&#8221; Blythe said frankly.
&#8220;Anything&#8217;s better than nothing. I happened to wander in here and
met a man with an auto. He works for the concern that&#8217;s going to tear the
camp down; a salvage concern. He got me this job. I don&#8217;t suppose
you&#8217;d call it a job, it&#8217;s an assignment. I picked out the three
buildings and they sent me a paper with the numbers on. I&#8217;ve only been
here a couple of days. Yesterday was the only time I was in Bridgeboro. I was
going to give it up. I didn&#8217;t have any supplies and I didn&#8217;t know
who to get to help me&#8211;I was mighty glad that friend of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span> yours came up yesterday
and said he&#8217;d tell you fellows it was all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s our scoutmaster,&#8221; said Pee-wee. &#8220;He&#8217;s all
right, only you&#8217;ve got to know how to manage him. We&#8217;ll start in
to-morrow morning and we&#8217;ll show that savage concern all right.
We&#8217;ll show them what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they won&#8217;t be so savage,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pee-wee can manage them,&#8221; Westy observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh sure, all you have to do is to know how to manage them,&#8221;
commented Connie. &#8220;They can&#8217;t come too savage for our young
hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can even tame wild flowers,&#8221; Roy said;
&#8220;lions&#8211;dandelions and tiger-lilies and everything. He eats them
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of eating, how about the stew?&#8221; Artie Van Arlen
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has to stew for an hour,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;Somebody get out
the tin plates; be prepared, that&#8217;s our motto. All the comforts of home.
Where&#8217;s <i>your</i> home?&#8221; he asked Blythe in a sudden impulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh I&#8217;m just a kind of a tramp,&#8221; Blythe said uneasily.
&#8220;I guess I must have left home before I had my eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>&#8220;That was
before you could walk,&#8221; Pee-wee reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last home I was in was in New York,&#8221; Blythe said. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re like we are,&#8221; Westy said, noticing perhaps
a little embarrassment in their friend&#8217;s manner, &#8220;our home is
outdoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And believe me, the sky has all the tin roofs I ever saw beaten twenty
ways,&#8221; observed Warde Hollister. That was pretty good for a new scout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roofs are all right to slide down,&#8221; Pee-wee observed.
&#8220;They&#8217;re all right as long as you&#8217;re not under
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, we wouldn&#8217;t have the sky over us if we didn&#8217;t
have to,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;It&#8217;s a blamed nuisance when it rains. The
trouble with the solar system is there are too many stars and planets and things
in it. You can&#8217;t get out into the open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; Pee-wee retorted
contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d get rid of all the stars, stationary stars, movie stars and
all,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>&#8220;Scouts are
supposed to like the stars,&#8221; Pee-wee informed Blythe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, if he had his own way he&#8217;d eat hunter&#8217;s stew out of
the Big Dipper,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;A lot he knows about the stars; he
doesn&#8217;t even know that Mercury is named after a thermometer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This bunch is crazy,&#8221; Pee-wee informed Blythe.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because we sleep under crazy quilts,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>Blythe just sat there laughing, the silent, diffident pleasure in his
countenance shown by the crackling, cheery blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do if you didn&#8217;t have the North Star, I&#8217;d
like to know?&#8221; Pee-wee demanded. &#8220;We&#8217;d be all roaming around
lost in the woods, dead maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should worry about roaming around dead,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;Do
you think I&#8217;ve got the North Star?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a look of pitying contempt, Pee-wee turned from Roy to the more
congenial bowl, now sizzling and bubbling on the fire. &#8220;It&#8217;s
ready,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>&#8220;Be
prepared,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;each one arm himself with a tin plate and
after that every scout for himself. This is called a hunter&#8217;s stew because
you have to hunt for the meat in it, but it&#8217;s got plenty of e-pluribus
unions in it. The potatoes and dumplings go to the patrol leaders, carrots to
first and second hand scouts; tenderfeet get nothing because the stew
isn&#8217;t tender enough....&#8221;</p>

<p>It was pleasant sitting there in the bright area surrounded by darkness,
chatting and planning the work for the morrow, and eating hunter&#8217;s stew,
scout style, patent applied for. And notwithstanding the slurs which Roy had
cast at the sky it was pleasant to see that vast bespangled blackness over head.
In the solemn night the neighboring shacks were divested of their tawdry
cheapness, the loose and flapping strips of tar-paper and the broken windows
were not visible, and the buildings seemed clothed in a kind of sombre
dignity&#8211;silent memorials of the boys who had made those old boards and
rafters ring with their shouts and laughter. Not a sound was there now from all
those barnlike remains of a life that was gone. Only the noise of the saw <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span> and the hammer would
resound where once the stirring revelry echoed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear some funny sounds here at night, when the wind blows,&#8221;
Blythe remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shh, listen; I hear something now,&#8221; one of the scouts said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that last night,&#8221; said Blythe uneasily; &#8220;or else I
dreamed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westy, who had been poking up the fire, paused, his stick poised, listening.
&#8220;It&#8217;s over there,&#8221; he said, pointing to the tall dark outline
of the windmill.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t breeze enough to turn the fan,&#8221; Doc Carson
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds like someone groaning,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>From the neighborhood of that old tower, though perhaps farther off, they
could not tell, came a sound almost human, a kind of moaning intermingled with a
plaintive wail, pitched in a higher key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spooky,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the kind of a place I like,&#8221; said Connie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>&#8220;Only
it&#8217;s nice to have somebody here,&#8221; Blythe admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, <i>we&#8217;re</i> here,&#8221; Pee-wee
said.</p>

<p>They did not hear the sound again. If one were superstitious he might have
conjured that sound into a crying of the ghost of some dead soldier haunting the
old forsaken camp. But these scouts did not believe in ghosts.</p>

<p>They did, however, believe in hunter&#8217;s stew and they forgot all else as
they sat around their camp-fire in the quiet darkness, telling yarns, and
amusing their new friend by jollying....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FALL OF SCOUT HARRIS</span></h2>

<p>As a camping place, perhaps the old reservation would not have proved a spot
to the heart of the woods lover, but it was sequestered and had about it that
romance which attaches to deserted habitations that are not tainted by the
sordid environments of city life. The old buildings had never been beautiful and
it was only the atmosphere of a place deserted which gave them a sort of
romantic character.</p>

<p>But Nature had not been forced to evacuate the camp area; trees and tiny
patches of woodland had remained, and the things which scouts love and seek had
reasserted their supremacy there after the last of the soldiers, and later the
army of clerical workers, had gone away.</p>

<p>The result was a kind of jumble of man&#8217;s hurried handiwork and
Nature&#8217;s persistence, and the place, for a while, was a novel, nay even a
delightful, spot in which to camp.</p>

<p>In conference with Blythe, who seemed cheerfully <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span> agreeable to any plan, the troop decided
that each patrol should have the task of demolishing a building, and should work
under the supervision of its leader, with Blythe as a sort of general
overseer.</p>

<p>The whole troop, however, bunked in a small fourth building because this
would not be in process of razing. From the appearance of this little building
it had been a sort of club or meeting place. The window glass was quite gone, as
indeed was all the window glass in the camp. Near by was a good place for their
camp and cook fire. The little shack had shelves on which the scouts kept their
stores. They made beds of balsam, scout fashion, and slept both in and
out-of-doors, as the weather dictated.</p>

<p>Roy was cook, as he always was on their troop enterprises. In his forages
against the stronghold of Chocolate Drop, the professional cook at Temple Camp,
he had learned much of the beloved art in which that grinning negro excelled.
The unruly flipflop tossed in air, fluttered down into his greasy pan like a
tamed bird. In Pee-wee&#8217;s experiments it had a perverse habit of alighting
on his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>Roy&#8217;s
spirit, indeed, seemed to pass into his cookery and give it a flavor all its
own. His bacon sizzled with joy. His coffee bubbled over with mirth. His
turnovers wore a scout smile. His baked potatoes had his own twinkle in their
eyes. His dumplings were indented with merry dimples like those in his own
cheeks.</p>

<p>The morning after their arrival they set to work in real earnest. They had
not a complete equipment of axes and saws, excepting their belt-axes, but as
much of the work consisted of gathering and piling the lumber, and removing
nails from it, there were implements enough for all. Some of the scouts worked
above, loosening the boards from the roofs, while others on the ground pulled
the tar-paper and nails from these and made an orderly pile of them.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of their work during the first two or three days and they
found it strenuous but neither too difficult nor heavy. And work was relieved
somewhat by the comedy element furnished by Pee-wee who rolled off a roof on one
occasion while eating a sandwich.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the nails out of him, pull the sandwich out of his hands, and
pile him up with the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
boards,&#8221; Roy called from a neighboring roof. &#8220;He&#8217;s docked
thirty cents for the time lost in rolling down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to have an emergency brake,&#8221; Westy suggested, as the
young Raven clambered up to his place again, sandwich and all, and proceeded
working with the sandwich in one hand and a hammer in the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say that&#8217;s all roofs are good for?&#8221;
Pee-wee vociferously demanded. &#8220;To roll off of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To roll <i>down</i>, I said,&#8221; Roy answered from his own perch
among the beams of the next shack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of anybody rolling up?&#8221; the young hero
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;didn&#8217;t you ever roll up and go to
sleep? You never rolled <i>down</i>, and went to sleep, did you? That shows what
you know about geometry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not geometry,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted. &#8220;I took
geometry last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time you put it back,&#8221; Roy called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out or you&#8217;ll take another tumble,&#8221; Westy added.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;He
didn&#8217;t put the last one back yet,&#8221; Roy observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes your sandwich,&#8221; another one of the Silver Foxes
called with glee, as that precious remnant of Pee-wee&#8217;s lunch went
tumbling and separating down the slanting roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see what you made me do!&#8221; he fairly screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Food is coming down,&#8221; Roy laughed.</p>

<p>This is a fair sample of the fun and banter which accompanied their work and
helped to make it easy and pleasant. Occasionally a harmless missile, perchance
a luscious fragment of some honorably discharged tomato, would float gracefully
from roof to roof bathing the face of some unsuspecting toiler with the crimson
hue of twilight. And once again the weather-stained old shacks would seem alive
with merriment and laughter.</p>

<p>As for Blythe he witnessed this merry progress with simple, grateful
pleasure. He had expected to see the work done, but he had not expected to see
it conjured by scout magic into a kind of play, nor the neighborhood of their
joyous labor transformed into a scene of rustic comfort.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>By the merest
chance the scouts had come and seen and conquered, and presently the scene had
that wholesome air of scout life about it. It seemed to poor Blythe as if he had
awakened and found himself in fairyland, with a score or more of small brown
gnomes climbing and scrambling about his domain, singing, jollying, planning,
laughing, working, cooking, eating, kindling big camp-fires with odds and ends
of wood, and telling such nonsensical yarns as he had never heard before.
Pee-wee and Roy in particular amused him greatly. &#8220;Go on, make fun of
him,&#8221; he would say to Roy. And then he would deliberately take sides with
Pee-wee against the whole troop. But he was more prone to listen than to
talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got any adventures to tell?&#8221; Pee-wee asked him
around camp-fire one night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;look in your pockets and see if you
can&#8217;t find a couple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m not much of a hand for adventures,&#8221; Blythe
laughed. &#8220;I like to hear about them though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you some,&#8221; Pee-wee said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
you how I found a wallet&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>&#8220;And a
dime,&#8221; Westy interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell how you saved a fish from drowning at Temple Camp,&#8221; Roy
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s a fish story,&#8221; Connie piped up.</p>

<p>So Pee-wee launched forth recounting instances from his career of glory at
Temple Camp, the boys prompting and jollying him, all to the simple delight of
their new friend. His enjoyment seemed always an incentive to banter and
nonsense....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>YOUNG MR. BLYTHE</span></h2>

<p>It was soon apparent to the scouts that their coming had saved the enterprise
for Blythe. He would not have been able to superintend the job with other
helpers and even with the scouts he was rather their companion than their
leader.</p>

<p>His attempts at sustained labor were pitiful. Yet he was never idle. But he
moved from one unfinished task to another, never realizing apparently that each
job he started was left undone. He was quite unequal to the harder part of the
work, and the scouts, both kind and observant, could see that, and were content
to let him gather and pile the fallen lumber and sometimes to rake up the
smaller pieces for their evening fire, which he looked forward to with keen
delight. What was the matter with him, they did not know. But this they did
know, that he was their friend and that he took a kind of childish delight in
their camping. He became excited <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_70'></a>70</span> easily and would sometimes seem almost at the point
of crying. He would throw down his saw or hammer in a kind of despair.</p>

<p>But these traits were not noticeable except in the working hours and not
always then. The boys kept up the fiction of his leadership, conferring with him
and consulting him about everything. And with open hearts they took him into
their scout life and liked him immensely.</p>

<p>The nearest they could get to a solution of his peculiarities was that he was
not well and that a long course of unemployment and privation had resulted in
his losing his grip. They took him as they found him, like the good scouts that
they were, and their enterprise to earn a little money for improving their
picturesque meeting-place at home seemed transformed into a collective, splendid
good turn in which their scout loyalty shone like a light.</p>

<p>And so the days of strenuous, cheerful toil, and the nights around the
companionable blaze, passed, and Blythe who seemed always fearful and
apprehensive of something appeared to be haunted with a kind of dread that this
remote and pleasant rustic life would come to an end.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>&#8220;We
won&#8217;t be finished next week?&#8221; he would say with a kind of simple air
of wishing to put off that evil time. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think so, do
you?&#8221; And Pee-wee would answer, &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, you leave
it to me. I&#8217;ll fix it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And evidently he did succeed in fixing it, for it rained steadily for three
days.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THREE&#8217;S A COMPANY</span></h2>

<p>And now, since the sun had reappeared and they had decided to take things a
little easier, Pee-wee announced his intentions of going on a pilgrimage to
Woodcliff to hunt up the mysterious Helen Shirley Bates, and to ascertain from
her the address of her soldier friend whom she had entertained at dinner during
the war. For it was on Pee-wee&#8217;s conscience that the soldier who had lost
his wallet had written a letter to his mother somewhere or other and that this
had never reached its destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to wear your Sunday uniform?&#8221; Roy asked. For
Pee-wee kept a special suit of scout khaki for ceremonial occasions. Upon the
sleeve of this were his merit badges.</p>

<p>On this notable pilgrimage, knowing the weakness of young ladies for official
regalia, he wore also his canteen (empty), his scout axe&#8211;to hew his way
into her presence perhaps&#8211;a coil of rope <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_73'></a>73</span> dangling from his belt, his scout scarf tied in the
celebrated &#8220;raven knot&#8221; and his hat inside out as a reminder that he
had not yet performed his daily good turn. Upon mailing the letter to its proper
address, and not until then, would Scout Harris, R.P. F.B.T. B.S.A., put his hat
on right side out. He also took some fudge which he had made as a tribute to his
unknown Woodcliff friend. He was prepared to chop her to pieces or to give her
candy, whichever the occasion required.</p>

<p>He was indeed a human quartermaster&#8217;s department and in addition to
this equipment he carried also somewhere in the depths of one of his pockets a
scout note book wherein the good scout rule of &#8220;jotting down things seen
by the way&#8221; was scrupulously obeyed. There were few wayside trifles that
escaped Scout Harris&#8217; observant eye. A sample page from this record of his
travels will give an idea of his thoroughness:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>August 10th. From Temple Camp to Catskill. Passed a worm also a piece of a
ginger snap. Passed a smell like a kitchen. Found a rubber heel in the road. A
dead <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>bug was upside
down in a puddle. Met a fence. Saw something that looked like a snake but it was
a shoe-lace. Had a soda in Catskill. Had another&#8211;raspberry. Saw a flat
tire as flat as a pancake and it started me thinking about pancakes.</p>
</div><!-- block quote -->

<p>And so on, and so on.</p>

<p>It was Roy whom Pee-wee chose to accompany him on his important mission. They
had reached a point about fifty yards from the shacks, two of which were
well-nigh demolished, when they heard a voice and turning saw Warde Hollister
drop from a rafter and come running toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is Woodcliff?&#8221; he asked, out of breath, and as if caught
by a sudden idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout six or seven miles,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know
just exactly where we&#8217;re going except that it&#8217;s somewhere around
Woodcliff Lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might make my last test,&#8221; Warde panted. &#8220;I just happened
to think of it.&#8221; He looked rather appealingly at Roy who was his patrol
leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ahead,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you thought of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>&#8220;Have you
got your note book?&#8221; Pee-wee vociferously demanded. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got to jot down everything you see and write a satisfactory description of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the test says <i>alone or with another scout</i>.&#8221; Warde
said doubtfully. &#8220;What do you think? It would be a peach of a chance and
I&#8217;m crazy to get my first class badge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is, are we to consider Pee-wee a scout?&#8221; Roy said,
winking at Warde. &#8220;Is he a scout or a sprout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as you say, you&#8217;re patrol leader,&#8221; Warde
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed Roy, &#8220;come ahead.
I&#8217;d have asked you only I never thought about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got your note book?&#8221; Pee-wee again demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Warde laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; Pee-wee assured him. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t make any difference whether one scout goes with you or
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>With such high legal authority as this, Warde&#8217;s mind was at rest. He
was the newest scout in the troop and a member of Roy&#8217;s patrol, the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span> Silver Foxes. He had made
a great hit in the troop and was immensely liked.</p>

<p>He had not been long enough a member of the Silver Fox patrol to have imbibed
the spirit of freedom with its sprightly leader which the others so hilariously
exhibited. The Silver Fox patrol was an institution altogether unique in
scouting. One had to be half crazy (as the Ravens and Elks said) before one
became a tried and true Silverplated Fox&#8211;warranted. The Silver Foxes had a
spirit all their own&#8211;and they were welcome to it.</p>

<p>Warde had shown his mettle by his tests, and also he had shown his fine
breeding and spirit by not pushing too aggressively into troop familiarity. If
he was not yet a full-fledged scout, he was at least a fine type for a scout,
and the uproarious Silver Foxes and their irrepressible leader were proud of
him.</p>

<p>He had now, as he had said, but one test to take before becoming a first
class scout. This meant more to him than it might have meant to another for he
had obtrusively prepared himself to claim several merit badges of the more
easily won sort, as soon as his first class rank <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> should enable him to properly lay claim
to these.</p>

<p>He was ahead of the game in fact, and hence the anxiety of his tone and
manner when he ran after Pee-wee and Roy, hoping that here might be the chance
of fulfilling the final requirement before the coveted first class badge should
be his. None fully knew how much he had dreamed of the first class badge. His
fine loyalty had kept him at work among them, but he had not been able to see
those two fare forth without jumping at the chance.</p>

<p>The test on which his achievement hung is on the same page of the handbook
with the picture of the badge he longed for:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>4.&#8211;Make a round trip alone (or with another scout) to a point at least
seven miles away (fourteen miles in all) going on foot or rowing a boat, and
write a satisfactory account of the trip, and things observed.</p> </div><!--
block quote -->

<p>Warde Hollister was not the one to strain the meaning of this. To him it
meant just exactly what it said. And so he had asked his patrol leader if it
would be all right for three to go instead <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_78'></a>78</span> of two. It was a small matter and of course it was
all right, as any scoutmaster or National Scout Somebody-or-other would have
agreed. The point is that Warde&#8217;s thinking about it was very
characteristic of him. In this instance he accepted his patrol leader&#8217;s
decision....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WARDE IS IN EARNEST</span></h2>

<p>It was not likely that Warde Hollister would forget his note book, for his
habit of keen observation and a knack he had for full and truthful description
had won him the post of troop scribe which Artie Van Arlen&#8217;s duties as
Raven patrol leader had compelled him to relinquish.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s seven miles there,&#8221; said Warde, plainly elated at
the thought of accompanying them, &#8220;all I&#8217;ll have to do is to write
my little description when I get back and there you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A first class scout,&#8221; said Pee-wee, quite as delighted as his
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;It says fourteen miles there and back,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;Maybe
it&#8217;ll be seven miles there but we don&#8217;t know how far it will be
back. Sometimes it&#8217;s longer one way than another. You never can
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me tired,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, you&#8217;re so clever,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;how far is
ten miles?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>&#8220;How
<i>far?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer in the affirmative,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
grasshopper, get out your note book.... Do you know what he did once?&#8221; he
asked, turning to Warde. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t jot down a fountain in Bronx
Park because he didn&#8217;t have a fountain pen&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy!&#8221; Pee-wee shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went into a store and asked for the handbook and when they told him
they didn&#8217;t have one he asked for the feetbook. He thinks the feetbook has
got all the daring feats in it. He&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe him,&#8221; Pee-wee yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before he was in the scouts he used to be a radiator ornament on an
automobile,&#8221; Roy persisted. &#8220;There&#8217;s a caterpillar, enter him
up, Kid,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up at Temple Camp,&#8221; Pee-wee yelled in merciless retaliation,
&#8220;they&#8211;they told him he could play on the veranda and he said he
could only play on the harmonica!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>&#8220;I admit
it,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;That was when I was a second-hand scout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to be called the Nickel Foxes, that&#8217;s what all the
scouts up at Temple Camp say,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted. &#8220;Because none of
them ever have more than five cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Raving Ravens haven&#8217;t got any sense,&#8221; Roy came back.
&#8220;Five is twice as good as nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows how much you know about arithmetic,&#8221; Pee-wee
retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good the boss isn&#8217;t here,&#8221; Warde said,
&#8220;or he&#8217;d laugh himself to death.&#8221; The boss was what they
always called Blythe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll say I didn&#8217;t discover <i>him</i>,&#8221;
Pee-wee demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the greatest discoverer next to Columbus, Ohio,&#8221;
Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well anyway, whoever discovered him, I like him,&#8221; Warde
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; said Roy quite ready for any topic of conversation.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t make him out but I like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just down and out, sort of,&#8221; Warde said. &#8220;Maybe
he&#8217;s been sick. That&#8217;s the way it seems <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> to me. But he likes us and I like him.
It&#8217;s fun to see him smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where he came from?&#8221; Roy asked, as they made their way
across fields. &#8220;He never says anything about where he belongs or
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he doesn&#8217;t know,&#8221; Warde said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t worry about his history,&#8221; said Roy.
&#8220;He&#8217;s all right and that&#8217;s enough. And he&#8217;s going up to
Temple Camp with us if I can get him to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;&#8221; began Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, you discovered Temple Camp,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;You
discovered the North Pole and the South Pole and the clothes pole and the
Atlantic Ocean and Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and you&#8217;ve got them
all down in your little book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No joking,&#8221; said Warde. &#8220;I was&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never joke,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;except from Mondays to
Saturdays, and on Sundays, morning, afternoon and evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Warde tried again, &#8220;I was going to ask you about test four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about it,&#8221; said the irrepressible
Pee-wee.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;How about
writing the satisfactory account?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t include worms and ginger snaps,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the usual way?&#8221; Warde persisted.</p>

<p>Seeing his new member to be serious and knowing with what a fine conscience
Warde sought every honor, Roy answered him with the best knowledge he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the way Mr. Ellsworth says,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You
must describe everything that might be helpful to your troop or to other troops
or to the whole country, maybe. That&#8217;s the way it is. Everything
that&#8217;s important or unusual you must notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly Mr. Ellsworth or one of the local council in Bridgeboro goes
over the ground and sees if the account is satisfactory. In some troops they
don&#8217;t do that. If it&#8217;s just written up all right they say it&#8217;s
all right and let it go at that. But Mr. Ellsworth says it isn&#8217;t just the
description that counts; it&#8217;s whether you notice everything. It
isn&#8217;t just knowing how to write. That&#8217;s just being a good author.
The other is being a good scout. See?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>&#8220;Some scouts
think they are authors,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pleasure is mine,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep
on writing our adventures as long as I have any paper. Then I&#8217;m going to
buy some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the fellow that buys the books,&#8221; said
Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;as long as you&#8217;re in the
books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I meant,&#8221; said Warde, trying to keep his
companions on the subject. &#8220;The description is a scout test?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, it is in our troop,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;Some scoutmasters
just take the description and if it&#8217;s good they say all right. But Mr.
Ellsworth and Mr. Kinney, he&#8217;s councilman, they&#8217;re crazy about
hiking. They usually take a sprint over the ground and most always they see
something that the scout forgot to mention. That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;d
turn him down though. You should worry, you&#8217;ll get away with it all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy had no doubt of that, and Pee-wee had no doubt of anything which made for
the glory of others. But they both noticed that during the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span> rest of their hike Warde was watchful and
preoccupied, occasionally jotting something down but oftener storing it in his
clear, fine memory. He was taking no chances and they knew it. Here was his
opportunity, he had grasped it just in the moment when it seemed to be passing
from him, and he was resolved that before he laid his head upon his balsam couch
that night he would be able to call himself a scout of the first class....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>BAFFLED?</span></h2>

<p>After a hike of about eight miles, part way across country and part way along
roads, the three scouts reached the beautiful Woodcliff Lake which lies in a
northwesterly direction from the old camp. Upon its shore they rested and ate
the compact little lunch which they had brought. The afternoon sun flickered on
the waters, the gentle slope across the lake was clad in the rich green of the
midsummertime, not a boat was to be seen upon that clear forbidden expanse, and
no sound was there in all the quiet country round about, save only the elated
voice of an angler on the causeway as he pulled up his line with a fish
wriggling on the end of it.</p>

<p>It is the duty of Woodcliff Lake to supply water to many thousands of homes
and the quietude of its shores and water breathes a kind of cleanliness and
purity, which imparts to the lake a character quite its own. An unique feature
of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span> it is the
causeway which bisects it, forming twin lakes, as it seems to the nearby
beholder. But from a distant elevation this straight clean roadway across the
very center of the lake stands out in bold relief, having none of the appearance
of a bridge nor yet of a dam. From this causeway people are permitted to fish
and their good luck is contemplated enviously by auto parties passing to and
fro.</p>

<p>The scouts had no difficulty in finding the home of Miss Helen Shirley Bates
in this fair neighborhood. They were told to go up a road till they came to
another road and to go up that road till they saw a gray house, etc., which
direction brought them at last face to face with an electric button which
Pee-wee pushed.</p>

<p>By the luck which he claimed to be his, a girl of perhaps nineteen or twenty
came to the door, who proved to be none other than the young lady of the calling
card. Here, however, Pee-wee&#8217;s luck deserted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re boy scouts and this is your card,&#8221; said the young
spokesman. &#8220;Do you like fudge?&#8221; he added, producing also a specimen
of his confectionery skill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>&#8220;Oh I just
adore it,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;but where did you get my card?
Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scouts were glad to rest in the comfortable wicker chairs on the deep,
shady porch, and here the girl listened to Pee-wee&#8217;s graphic account of
his finding of the old wallet. He explained that it was his regular custom to
find things and that this need give her no surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;But to think that it had my card in it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and
that it has been stuck away in that damp, spooky place for two years. I think
it&#8217;s <i>just wonderful</i> for you to come and find me. And I think
it&#8217;s lovely for you to want to send the letter to that soldier&#8217;s
mother; oh I think it&#8217;s just <i>fine</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scouts have to do good turns,&#8221; Pee-wee said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me feel as if I can just see that soldier now,&#8221; she
said, reading the old letter. &#8220;And to think he was on his way here. But I
just don&#8217;t know any more about him than you do because he never got here.
I just don&#8217;t know a <i>single thing</i> about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even his name?&#8221; Warde asked, hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even his name. You see, I&#8217;ll tell you <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span> how it was,&#8221; she continued, drawing
her chair a little closer to them. &#8220;All the people around here used to
have soldiers from camp to dinner on Sundays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, they did that in Bridgeboro where we live,&#8221; said Warde.
&#8220;We had a couple of them one Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We just sent word to the Y.M.C.A. that we would be glad to have two
soldiers come. I sent my card because I thought that would be nicer. We did that
several times, mother and I. And we never knew the names of the soldiers till
they got here. The camp officials wouldn&#8217;t let us invite them by name. It
was lots of fun to see what kind of boys came. Some of them belonged &#8217;way, &#8217;way
out west. Once when we were expecting two, only one came. He said the other was
going to hike here. But the other one never came. We <i>waited</i> and
<i>waited</i> and <i>waited</i>, and then we had dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys&#8217; hopes fell at this recital. The girl, too, seemed to take her
inability to help them very much to heart. The boys all recalled now that
patriotic custom of the wartime of inviting soldiers from the camp to enjoy a
little interval <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span> of
home life at week ends. The rule which prevented hospitable citizens from making
choice of their guests gave the kindly custom the pleasant character of a game
of chance. One never knew what one would draw out of the camp grab-bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I never thought about that,&#8221; Roy said plainly
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember the name of the soldier that did come?&#8221; Warde
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she confessed, regretfully. &#8220;You see we
had two each Sunday for a while. I think it&#8217;s just too bad you can&#8217;t
send the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it doesn&#8217;t make so much difference,&#8221; said Warde.
&#8220;He&#8217;s home by this time, or perhaps he never went over.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this did not impress her and she could only say, &#8220;Oh I think
it&#8217;s just too bad. It&#8217;s such a <i>lovely</i> letter. I&#8217;d just
like to see that home. I just feel as if I <i>can</i> see it&#8211;the broken
window and all. And to think of all the trouble you have gone to. Oh I
<i>wish</i> I could help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Roy said; &#8220;you should
worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you think we&#8217;re foiled,&#8221; said Pee-wee, &#8220;but
that shows how much you know about scouts. As long as we&#8217;ve got a broken
window and a dog <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
that must have a collar because he&#8217;s supposed to be tied, to go
by&#8211;and a puddle and some things.... Do you know what those things are?
They&#8217;re clues.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh but you can <i>never</i> do it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to do a good turn?&#8221; Pee-wee asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do,&#8221; she said, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what a legal document is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Good night</i>,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to
get out a warrant for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows how much you know,&#8221; said Pee-wee. &#8220;I want a
great big long envelope like a legal document comes in. Did you ever see a
deed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;a kind deed, I&#8217;ve done a lot of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you pay any attention to him,&#8221; said Miss Bates.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never do,&#8221; said Pee-wee; &#8220;he&#8217;s crazy, he belongs
to a crazy patrol. If I can get an envelope big enough I&#8217;ll write
everything on it that will help the post office people, and maybe they&#8217;ll
be resourceful, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the envelope my examination <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span> papers came in,&#8221; said the girl
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you study rhetoric?&#8221; Pee-wee demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I just <i>hate</i> it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just you wait
a minute,&#8221; she added, going into the house. She presently reappeared with
an envelope large enough to contain a brief history of the world on its outside,
and together she and Pee-wee made up the detailed address which, in
Pee-wee&#8217;s handwriting, was destined to astonish Postmaster Hiram Hicks, of
Hicksville, North Carolina.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>WITHIN REACH</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;ll get it, you can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; Pee-wee said
as they took their way back to camp, the big envelope stuck under his belt, like
a death warrant carried by some awful dignitary of old. &#8220;Anyway I&#8217;m
glad we came because it will make Warde a first class scout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pee-wee was strong for the scouts and the troop even though he looked with a
kind of lofty scorn on the Silver Foxes. That Warde should become a first class
scout was a matter of honest joy to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a full seven miles all right,&#8221; said Roy, referring to the
distance mentioned in the test, &#8220;so I guess you&#8217;re as good as in the
first class. I&#8217;m good and tired, I know that. You gave them good
measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet you&#8217;re proud,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet I am,&#8221; Warde answered. &#8220;I feel like <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> a real scout now. A fellow
isn&#8217;t a real scout till he gets into the first class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sprouts and scouts,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you write up your account don&#8217;t forget to put down about my
talking to that girl,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh I&#8217;ll put everything down, don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; said
Warde, clearly elated at the thought that the coveted badge was as good as won.
&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m going to have Mr. E. going over the ground and
putting anything over on me? Not so you&#8217;d notice it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet Blythe will be glad,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh boy! Won&#8217;t he!&#8221; vociferated Pee-wee. &#8220;I can just
see him smiling when I tell him about it,&#8221; said Warde.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows a lot about scouting since he met me,&#8221; Pee-wee informed
them. &#8220;Anyway, maybe we killed two birds with one stone, hey? Maybe that
fellow&#8217;s mother will get the letter and we know Warde is a first class
scout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows what kind of a scout you are,&#8221; said Roy;
&#8220;throwing stones at birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; Pee-wee said, &#8220;that&#8217;s an
adverb.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>&#8220;You mean a
proverb,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;A lot you know about grammar; you don&#8217;t
know the difference between a proposition and an injunction. He thinks
Boys&#8217; Life is a musical instrument because it&#8217;s the scouts&#8217;
official organ. You&#8217;re lucky not to be wished onto the Ravens,&#8221; he
said to Warde.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a full scout, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m thinking of,&#8221;
Warde laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m an empty one,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; Pee-wee shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you agree about something,&#8221; Warde laughed.
He felt like laughing. He seemed to walk on air. &#8220;I&#8217;m an empty one,
too,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hike back through Westwood and get
something to eat there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carried by an unanimous majority,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>It was just exactly like Warde Hollister to give himself up to frank elation
at this achievement of full scouthood. For so he regarded it. He had been the
only second class scout in the troop, and those words <i>second class</i> had
not been pleasant to his ears. With him it was all or nothing. His thoughts were
fixed on high.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>To the natural
enthusiasm of the new scout was added his own natural enthusiasm and fine, high
spirit. He did not want to be a star scout; he must be an eagle scout. He did
not want the bronze cross or the silver cross; he would win the gold cross. The
tenderfoot and second class ranks were not steps <i>in</i> scouting, they were
steps to scouting. And until now he had thought of himself as an outsider. He
was wrong in this, of course, but that was Warde Hollister.</p>

<p>Since Warde was in the troop it was a kind of disgrace to the troop and to
his patrol that he should not be a first class scout. So he thought. The tests
in the handbook he had found not difficult to pass. In the case of this final
one it was just a question of appropriate opportunity. Until this day he had
scorned to lay down his work. For that also was a test. You see that all the
tests are not in the handbook, and that is the trouble. Wherever a scout goes he
bumps into tests which the very wise men who made the handbook never dreamed
of.</p>

<p>To pass a test is one thing. To <i>stand</i> a test is something else.</p>

<p>Little Warde Hollister knew of the great test that awaited him.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>RIGHT SIDE OUT</span></h2>

<p>And so Warde Hollister, with the gateway leading to every merit badge and
scout honor now thrown open to him, hiked back with his two companions, and was
not weary, for there is no weariness when joy dances in the heart.</p>

<p>Their hike back took them through the pleasant town of Westwood where our
young hero with his formidable envelope still stuck in his belt must have looked
like an official come to read the riot act or a proclamation or, perchance, to
demand a hostage. But they are a fearless race in Westwood and only smiled as
the doughty hero passed through, and one inquisitive little girl asked her
mother why he had his hat on inside out.</p>

<p>The bakery in Westwood was closed so they deferred their refreshment till
they should reach the next village southward. Warde did not see much of the town
for wherever he looked the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_98'></a>98</span> first class scout badge seemed to be staring him in
the face. It loomed up larger than towns and villages.</p>

<p>Their way took them now southward along the Kinderkamack Road with its high
terraced houses to the right and to the left the low marshy land stretching away
to the river. Along the road they had to pass several villages before reaching
the point where it would be well to leave the road and cut through the country
eastward to camp.</p>

<p>Into the post office of one of these places strode Scout Harris. He stamped
his letter, dropped it through the slot, then having done his good turn he
proceeded to turn his hat right side out, and his conscience was at rest.</p>

<p>So it happened that two or three days later old Mrs. Haskell, in her
tumbling-down white house, read the letter which her soldier boy had written her
more than two years before. Little did she dream as she laid this reverently
away with that blunt, harsh notification of his death, that a scout had taken
off his hat to her as scouts do across all those miles and miles of
country....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A REVELATION</span></h2>

<p>As Pee-wee turned from the mail slot he saw Warde and Roy gazing at a very
antiquated bulletin board such as one seldom sees elsewhere than in a country
post office.</p>

<p>These ancient bulletin boards bespeak the country as eloquently as do the
hayfields. They seem never to be new. Articles lost but long since restored to
their owners are still advertised on faded brittle paper, fastened by rusted
thumb tacks of a bygone age. Strawberry festivals, with strawberries that have
gone the way of all strawberries, are here announced. Auction sales and Red
Cross drives long ended here proclaim themselves like ghosts out of the dead
past. Letters waiting patiently for people whose names are on tombstones are
here listed.</p>

<p>Pee-wee pressed his way between Warde and Roy and gazed at a notice by no
means new <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span> which,
partly overlapped by later notices, had caught the eyes of his two friends:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>WANTED FOR MURDER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS</p>

<p>REWARD WILL BE PAID BY THE POLICE OF QUEBEC, CANADA, FOR INFORMATION LEADING
TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF CLAUDE DARRELL, ALIAS DARROW, ALIAS HICKEY JOE,
ETC., ETC. WANTED FOR BURGLARY AND HOMICIDE.</p>

<p>Was last seen in New York, where he tried to enlist for military service.
Hair brown and straight. Complexion dark. Eyes gray. Height 5 feet 10-1/2
inches. Weight about 140 pounds. Teeth white and even. May seek work as
gasfitter. When last seen wore a gray suit with double-breasted vest. Walks
slightly sideways.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p>But it was not the reading matter on this notice which riveted the attention
of the scouts and for a few moments held them speechless. Two pictures, one a
front face, the other a profile, were there shown.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;What&#8211;&#8221; Pee-wee began, anxiously,
hesitatingly, as if he dared not say what was in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; said Warde, with a kind of cold resolve, as if one of them
must express their common thought; &#8220;it&#8217;s him&#8211;it&#8217;s
Blythe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still neither Roy nor Pee-wee spoke, only stood there, gazing steadfastly at
the pictures. The eyes in the full face picture were looking straight at them.
There was the least suggestion of a smile on the mouth. It seemed as if Blythe
might be saying in that simple, pleased way of his, &#8220;Congratulations, now
you&#8217;re a regular scout.&#8221; Warde averted his gaze. He felt almost
sickened. Then he looked at the pictures again, steadily, intensely.... He
seemed only half conscious of Roy saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask the
postmaster how long that&#8217;s been there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then suddenly Roy felt the authority of his new scout, subordinate though
that scout was. He felt Warde&#8217;s hand detaining him. &#8220;Ask him
nothing,&#8221; he heard Warde say; &#8220;stay where you are.&#8221; Pee-wee
felt this calm authority, too. Or <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_102'></a>102</span> rather this influence of one who is well poised and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>And still, with spirits drooping, with the whole foundation of their
happiness rudely knocked from under them as it seemed, they stood gazing at
these pictures of their friend. This murderer. Here was another murder to add to
that former one in Canada. The murder of all their hopes and plans.... The
killing of a friendship.</p>

<p>They heard the man behind the lock-boxes come through the little gate. They
heard the gate swing shut. They felt a presence near them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you find to interest you, boys?&#8221; they heard a
drawling voice ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were&#8211;we were just wishing that we had been at the strawberry
festival&#8211;the one a year ago last June,&#8221; replied Warde Hollister.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TEST</span></h2>

<p>The three scouts took their way along the road in silence. Pee-wee was
subdued and even Roy sobered. Warde alone seemed composed. Perhaps none of them
had realized until now how much they had grown to like young Blythe. And this
appalling revelation was the sequel, the end, of that merry, novel camping
adventure. They were not fired by the dramatic character of their discovery;
they were just cast down. <i>This</i> was what it had all come to....</p>

<p>Pee-wee was the first to regain some of his former spirit. &#8220;Just the
same, maybe that fellow&#8217;s mother will get the letter,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;so that&#8217;s one good thing. And later we&#8217;re going to Temple
Camp, that&#8217;s another. And Warde is a first class scout, so gee whiz, we
ought to be all good and glad, that&#8217;s sure.&#8221; But for all that,
Pee-wee did not seem good and glad.</p>

<p>He tried again. &#8220;A fellow ought to be glad <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span> when he gets to be a first class scout,
that&#8217;s one sure thing. Even if I were in the Silver Foxes I&#8217;d be
glad. And anyway it&#8217;s good you had your fourteen mile hike to-day because
now you can let Mr. Ellsworth and the local council know and he can go over the
ground Sunday. That&#8217;s the way he usually does. You can write up your
account to-morrow and the next day. Then you can try for any merit badge you
want. I bet you&#8217;ll get a lot of them. I bet your father will be glad when
you tell him you&#8217;re in the first class, hey?... I bet Roy will be proud,
too,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Roy made no response, only walked along silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any badge, Kid,&#8221; said Warde kindly.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t going to be any account written of this. And Mr.
Ellsworth isn&#8217;t going to go over the ground.... He isn&#8217;t going to
see that picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments none of them spoke. Several men raking hay in a nearby
field waved to them, as people do to scouts, and the three waved their arms in
answer, but there was not much enthusiasm in their act. The birds chirped <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span> among the bordering
trees. A nimble little chipmunk paused upon a stone wall, looked at them pertly,
and disappeared in a crevice of rock. And so they walked on, no one
speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Roy asked after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; said Warde. &#8220;Mr. Ellsworth saw Blythe. He
isn&#8217;t going to see that picture. I don&#8217;t care anything about the
badge. Let&#8217;s not talk about it. It&#8217;s off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that we should protect that&#8211;that fellow?&#8221; Roy
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that this isn&#8217;t my test,&#8221; said Warde. &#8220;I mean
I&#8217;m not going to claim the badge. No one can make me claim it if I
don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means that you want us to keep still about Blythe,&#8221; Roy
said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t get around that. If you think I&#8211;if you think
I care anything about five thousand dollars you&#8217;re&#8211;then you&#8217;re
mistaken. My father wouldn&#8217;t let me take any money I got that way.... But
a scout is&#8211;he&#8217;s supposed to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s supposed to watch his step,&#8221; said Warde.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he is, Roy,&#8221; piped up Pee-wee. &#8220;Gee, you can&#8217;t
deny that, Roy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s supposed to know where he&#8217;s
at when it comes to something serious,&#8221; said Warde. &#8220;He&#8217;s
supposed to look before he leaps&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t deny that, Roy,&#8221; spoke the big heart of Pee-wee
Harris. &#8220;He&#8217;s supposed to look before he leaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy smiled. &#8220;Well, what are we going to do?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you asking me?&#8221; Warde queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m asking you. It&#8217;s Blythe&#8217;s picture,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re patrol leader and I&#8217;m a second class scout,&#8221;
said Warde. &#8220;What do <i>you</i> say to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, a second class scout?&#8221; Roy demanded, his voice
full of feeling. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any better scouts in my patrol than
you. I&#8217;m asking you what we&#8217;re going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; Warde said. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to keep still until we&#8217;re dead sure. We know what kind of a fellow
Blythe is, and they don&#8217;t, I mean the sheriff and police and those people.
We know he&#8217;s a good friend. Sometimes when you look at a picture it
reminds you of someone, and the next time you look at it, it
doesn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_107'></a>107</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Roy,&#8221; Pee-wee urged
with great vehemence, &#8220;because once I thought a man looked like George
Washington and afterwards I saw he didn&#8217;t. So you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to tell about this to-morrow and maybe not the
next day,&#8221; said Warde. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to make <i>dead sure</i>.
Then if we have to, we&#8217;ll have to, that&#8217;s all. Blythe isn&#8217;t
going to run away and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re likely to take that
notice down for about forty-eleven years. We don&#8217;t want Mr. Ellsworth
blowing into that post office; not yet. I&#8217;m not worrying about my scout
rank, that can wait too. I&#8217;m thinking about what we&#8217;ve
lost&#8211;maybe. I&#8217;m not thinking about what I wanted to get.
Everything&#8211;it looks like&#8211;everything is changed&#8211;all the fun
and&#8211;what do I care about the old badge?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus spoke Warde Hollister, second class scout.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DULL BLAZE</span></h2>

<p>This was all very well, and his willing sacrifice of the coveted badge in the
interest of friendship and loyalty showed Warde&#8217;s character. But he and
his two companions found small comfort in an excuse for delay. This was a
serious business, a business for man&#8217;s handling, and in their hearts they
knew it. Yet on the other hand it seemed right, and due to their friend, that
they should make assurance doubly sure.</p>

<p>One fact, and only one, did comfort them. Blythe wore no double-breasted
vest; he wore no vest at all. But in the downward path of tramp life and
poverty, the vest is very apt to disappear. Against this little gleam of forlorn
hope was the fact that Blythe did wear a gray suit. And that suit was very old
and shabby; as old as the notice with the picture, surely. For the rest, the
printed description seemed all too accurate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>It was a
preoccupied and downcast trio that made their way through the old reservation to
the scene of their recent toil and pleasure. How familiar seemed the spot! How
friendly, and abounding in pleasant memories of their odd camping adventure!
Their companions were just getting through for the day. Doc Carson and Connie
Bennett were shinnying down one of the corner uprights of a bare frame, several
scouts were piling some odds and ends, and Blythe, anxious as usual to get the
camp-fire started, was gathering chips and small bits of waste lumber for that
purpose. He heard them coming and looked up smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a big one to-night,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it,&#8221; called Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A welcome home fire, hey?&#8221; said Blythe. Roy felt almost
sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just in time to cook supper,&#8221; said Westy. &#8220;We
were going to send a tracer after you. What news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll tell you later,&#8221; said Warde.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the &#8220;boss&#8221; walked toward Blythe&#8217;s Bunk, as the
scouts had named their little headquarters, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_110'></a>110</span> and tumbled his gatherings near the fireplace.
Warde tried to determine whether he did actually walk a little sideways. But he
could not be sure. It is so easy to imagine these things, to see something when
one is looking for it.</p>

<p>There were no secrets within the First Bridgeboro Troop and what the three
scouts had seen was soon known to all the others. It completely overshadowed the
finding of Miss Bates and the disappointment of Pee-wee at not ascertaining the
name and address of the unknown soldier. They did not talk freely about these
things, chiefly because of their appalling discovery, and partly also because
there was a certain constraint around the camp-fire that night.</p>

<p>The talk and banter which before had been so free and merry could not be kept
up; they could not do it, try as they would. The conversation was not
spontaneous, and the few pitiful attempts at joking were forced. Even Roy seemed
to have lost his corklike buoyancy. And for Pee-wee, he could only sit gazing
across the fire at Blythe with a kind of fearful fascination. Different, but
equally intent, was the almost steady <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_111'></a>111</span> gaze of Warde Hollister. Roy noticed this; others
noticed it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only one who was quite at ease was the &#8220;boss&#8221;
himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what Doctor Cawson did to-day,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Edwin (Doc) Carson was in the Raven Patrol and was called Doc because he was
the troop&#8217;s official first aid scout. He was the son of a physician, which
fact had doubtless helped to raise him to proficiency in that splendid part of
scouting. It was one of Blythe&#8217;s most noticeable characteristics that he
got the names of the scouts confused in his mind. Almost the only name which he
consistently pronounced correctly was Will Dawson. And he pronounced Carson the
same as he pronounced Dawson.</p>

<p>Whether he really thought that Doc was a young physician it would be hard to
say. His simple admiration of the scouts amounted to a kind of reverence, and he
gave them credit for professional excellence in the case of all their honors. To
him their merit badges meant that they were aviators, astronomers, chemists, and
what not. And he always spoke of Doc Carson as &#8220;doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Roy, half-heartedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found a robin under the flooring of the last shack,&#8221; said
Blythe in his usual simple way. &#8220;His wing was dragging open. I closed it
up and carried him in my hand like you said about carrying a bird. I held him
till the doctor came, and he said the wing wasn&#8217;t broken, only strained.
He stood him on a branch and in a little while he flew away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you kill him and be done with it?&#8221; Warde
asked.</p>

<p>Blythe just laughed. &#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Righto,&#8221; said Hunt Ward of the Elks.</p>

<p>Followed then an interval of silence, broken only by the mounting blaze.
Everyone seemed to experience a little relaxation of the constraint. For a
minute it seemed as if the spirits of the company rose. It was just for a
moment.</p>

<p>Warde&#8217;s gaze was fixed directly on Blythe, who seemed calm, content,
and happy to be among them. He at least showed no constraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say that robin will be in Canada by morning,&#8221; Warde said.
&#8220;They go as far north as Montreal before they turn south. Hey,
Roy?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>&#8220;Some of
them do,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a place I&#8217;d like to go to&#8211;Montreal,&#8221;
said Warde. &#8220;Ever been there Blythey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Montreal?&#8221; said Blythe. &#8220;Not as I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Toronto?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blythe shook his head. &#8220;Toronto&#8217;s up near there, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Warde seemed on the point of asking more but apparently decided not to.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to tell a yarn?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;This is a kind
of slow bunch to-night. How about you, Roy?&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VOICE</span></h2>

<p>The camp-fire had died, the last embers had been trodden out, the scouts had
turned in for the night. A half dozen or so fresh air enthusiasts lay upon their
couches of balsam under a big elm, through the high branches of which the stars
looked down upon the weary toilers, dead to the world. For a precious interval
at least they would feel no disappointment. It was well that they were tired
that night.</p>

<p>They had not decided what they should do, but they knew they could not
conceal a criminal and take money from him and count him their companion. They
must do a detestable thing; they must go home and tell. They did not relish
doing this, they <i>could</i> not relish it. They were not of the class of
detectives. They were capable of feeling contemptible....</p>

<p>There, close to where they slept, were the results <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span> of their faithful labor. And there,
too, were the dead embers of their cheerful fire around which they and their
strange, likable companion, had gathered night after night. One shack had
completely disappeared, another stood there in the darkness like a skeleton to
mock them, the third was to have been tackled in dead earnest in the morning.
Then would come the dividing of the money&#8211;oh, the whole thing would seem
like a dream when they awakened.</p>

<p>Only Warde and Roy were abroad on that still night. They sat upon the sill of
a shack rather more pretentious than the barnlike buildings all about, for it
had been officers&#8217; quarters. There were even the rotten remnants of
curtains in the windows, necessary no doubt to help defeat the Germans. The
neighborhood was very quiet and very dark, save for the sounds caused by the
breeze in those old wrecks of buildings. Every rusty hinge and loose board and
creaky joint seemed to contribute to this dismal music. One might easily have
imagined those dark, spectral structures to be tenanted by the ghosts of dead
soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you mention Quebec?&#8221; Roy asked. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span> &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you ask him if he had been there? That was the place named in the
notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t what I was thinking about,&#8221; Warde said.
&#8220;I was reading in the old scout handbook<a id='FNanchor_2'></a><a
href='#Footnote_2' class='fnanchor'><sup>[2]</sup></a> how you can tell where
people come from by their talk. If a person belongs in Canada he&#8217;ll say
Monreal instead of Montreal. He&#8217;ll say Tranto instead of
Toronto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; urged Roy, hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; Warde said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t talk as
if he came from up that way. But the notice didn&#8217;t say he belonged there,
it only said he was wanted there. The way he spoke about the robin was what got
me. I can&#8217;t make him out at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the picture&#8217;s the principal thing,&#8221; Roy said
despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal thing is to wait a day or so,&#8221; said Warde;
&#8220;and see what we can find out. It looks bad, that&#8217;s sure. It&#8217;s
his picture as far as I can see. I don&#8217;t see how we&#8217;re going to take
his measurement; we don&#8217;t want to make him suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_117'></a>117</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny how he never speaks about
his past,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody can see there&#8217;s something funny about him,&#8221; Warde
said. &#8220;What he said about the robin makes me think that if he committed a
murder he was probably crazy when he did it. Maybe he doesn&#8217;t even
remember that he did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say he&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; Roy protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I like him,&#8221; Warde said; &#8220;I just can&#8217;t help
it. I like him now. Maybe he isn&#8217;t smart, but he&#8217;s always thinking
about us. He&#8217;s for the scouts good and strong. Maybe it&#8217;s because
he&#8217;s so simple and easy&#8211;maybe that&#8217;s what makes me like him so
much....&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments neither spoke. It seemed as if both were preoccupied by
pleasant memories of their friend. Weak, uncertain, queer he may have been, and
a failure into the bargain. Shabby and all that. But his smile haunted them now;
he had been their comrade, their friend, their champion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something always gets in the way when you try to swing a <i>big</i>
good turn,&#8221; Roy mused.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes Pee-wee to manage the big ones,&#8221; said Warde.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>&#8220;Poor
kid,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>Again neither spoke. A loose board creaked somewhere in the darkness. A crude
little weathervane, the handiwork of some departed soldier, rattled nearby.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Listen</i>,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;Do you hear that voice
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke a long, discordant cry could be heard somewhere in the distance,
ending in a spasmodic jerk. It was like nothing human. Yet strangely it
suggested something human. As if some unearthly ghoul were trying to simulate
the wailing of human anguish.... Then again it was quite grotesque, bearing no
resemblance to the cry of a living thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose it is?&#8221; Warde asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a&#8211;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Roy doubtfully.
&#8220;I never heard anything just like that before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound was not continuous, but came at intervals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what I&#8217;d like to do?&#8221; said Warde.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get just one good look at Blythe while he&#8217;s lying
asleep. I&#8217;d like to see his face calm and still like in the picture.
I&#8217;d like to see it when he isn&#8217;t looking at me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_119'></a>119</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; said Roy, caught by
the idea. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. Maybe we can tell better.&#8221;</p>

<p>They returned to their camp, as they called it, through the dismantled frame
of the first shack, and past the sleepers under the big elm. Pee-wee was there,
tied in a bowline knot, the official knot of the Raven patrol, sleeping the
sleep of the righteous.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he should hear us, remember we&#8217;re just turning in,&#8221;
said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got your flashlight?&#8221; Warde asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Roy whispered. &#8220;Walk softly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They entered the sleeping shack, &#8220;Blythe&#8217;s Bunk,&#8221; and
tiptoed to the spot where Blythe usually lay. Then Roy turned on his light.</p>

<p>The two scouts stood appalled, speechless. Blythe&#8217;s old shabby coat
which he always folded and used as a pillow was there with the depression made
by his head still in it. But Blythe had gone away....</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DIAGONAL MARK</span></h2>

<p>Warde had always his wits with him. &#8220;<i>Shh</i>, don&#8217;t wake up
the troop,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Come outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll need them all&#8211;alarm&#8211;&#8221; Roy whispered
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up and come outside,&#8221; Warde whispered emphatically. He
picked up Blythe&#8217;s coat and, tiptoeing, led the way out into the night.
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t gone away,&#8221; he said more freely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see this coat? Do you think he&#8217;d go away without his coat? Stick your
flashlight here, <i>quick</i>; here&#8217;s our chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Warde held the collar of the poor threadbare coat close to Roy&#8217;s light.
There, on the inside was sewn a little cloth square on which was printed:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>DOMINION CLOTHING CO.<br /> QUEBEC, CANADA.</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;I
see,&#8221; Roy whispered, not knowing what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the light and wait a second&#8211;shh,&#8221; said Warde.</p>

<p>Before Roy knew it Warde had re-entered the shack and was folding and
replacing the coat where he had found it. In a kind of daze Roy saw the bright
spot near the empty balsam couch, saw his companion&#8217;s quick, silent
movements, saw the scouts lying asleep in the dim light. Then all was darkness
within and he saw no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you feel in the pockets?&#8221; Roy asked as they betook
themselves through the darkness to a safe distance. He still whispered, though
there was no need of it now. He was nervous, agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not in that line of business,&#8221; said Warde.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s Claude Darrell all right,&#8221; said Roy.
&#8220;What shall we do? Try to find him? There&#8217;s that voice again. Do you
hear it? It&#8217;s over there&#8211;west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not find him but <i>follow</i> him,&#8221; said Warde. &#8220;If we
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay here,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;give me the light, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span> I&#8217;ll track
him.&#8221; Roy was master here and Warde could only accede.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do when we find him?&#8221; Roy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to find out what <i>he&#8217;s</i> doing,&#8221;
Warde said.</p>

<p>Nimbly, as silently as a panther, Roy retraced his steps to the shack. For a
few minutes Warde stood alone, waiting, conscious of Roy&#8217;s experience and
superiority in those more active arts of the scout. He had not the slightest
knowledge in which direction Blythe had gone and his patrol leader was going to
wrench this knowledge from the darkness. Off in the distance the unearthly voice
crooning and whining in the night. The very air seemed charged with something
impending.</p>

<p>Presently Warde saw two quick flashes of the light, then two more. He was
glad that he knew the Silver Fox patrol signs well enough to know the meaning of
that one. It signified &#8220;<i>Come.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went in his bare feet,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;look there.
See?&#8221;</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>Upon the soft
ground was the imprint of a bare heel with the additional imprint of a diagonal
mark upon it. Perhaps Warde would not have recognized this for a heel print, nor
the faint suggestions of another print two or three inches distant, for a toe
print. But these were easily recognizable by Roy and they indicated the
direction also.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he didn&#8217;t have his shoes on,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Now we know he&#8217;s got some kind of a scar on his foot. Come ahead,
follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eight or ten of these prints, among many others which Roy did not pause to
distinguish, brought them to the concrete road which runs through the old
reservation, the Knickerbocker Road, as it is called. Here the leader of the
Silver Foxes was baffled. There was no following footprints here.</p>

<p>They paused for a moment, considering. The white road stretched like a ribbon
straight north and south. The temporary makeshift cross streets could be seen in
black outline with their silent, ghostly, gloomy buildings, standing in more or
less regular order. Here and there was an area of lesser darkness where some
boarded side had fallen away revealing the fresher wood of the interiors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>The two scouts
moved northward a little way along this permanent, central road, the backbone of
the old camp. Still they could hear that strange, unearthly voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the darkness near them sped a form. It crossed the road,
entered one of the old buildings and hurriedly emerged, entering another. It
seemed like some lost spirit of the night. It passed within ten feet of the
scouts, never noticing them. It seemed intent with a kind of diabolical
intentness. Meanwhile the voice continued, now mournful, now petulant, now
clear, now modulated, according to the rising wind.</p>

<p>The two scouts paused spellbound as if in a place haunted. The figure had
disappeared but they could hear the patter of its running, and once or twice a
fleeting dark shadow. The breeze was freshening and conjuring every sound about
the ramshackle buildings into spectral wailings. A fragment of glass falling
from a window startled the listeners. Agitated, their nerves tense, they
strained their eyes for glimpses of the hurrying apparition and listened to the
ghostly concert.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_125'></a>125</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s he,&#8221; said Warde;
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to catch him. Do you think that sound is a tree toad?
<i>Listen!</i>&#8221; He pulled his hat on tighter because of the rising
wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;First I thought it was,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t.
They make funny noises but not like that. It&#8217;s off there and up high.
It&#8217;s not any animal&#8211;or loose boards or anything like that. Come
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the blackness arose a piercing scream. Its echo resounded
from the dried boards of some building and re-echoed from another as if its
terror-stricken owner had three voices. It mingled with that wailing voice,
distant, aloof. Then they heard human words, sounding strange and unhuman.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;m coming! Wait, I&#8217;m coming!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It sounded farther and farther off until it was drowned in the distant
moaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>It&#8217;s he,</i>&#8221; Warde whispered, his voice tense.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where it is; come on,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BANSHEE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean, anyway?&#8221; Warde asked, as he followed Roy,
breathless and in suspense. &#8220;What are we going to do? Has he got
some&#8211;some&#8211;accomplice&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; was all that Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The troop&#8211;if we&#8217;re in danger&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the troop; follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently Roy sped along into an overgrown cross street, cutting through the
doorless wreck of the Y. M. C. A. shack, over the litter within, and out on the
opposite side. A tall, spectral shadow soon confronted them, whence emanated
that ghostly voice, loud and beseeching, as they approached. Their nearness to
it dispelled any thought of its being the inanimate sounds of wind-stirred
wreckage or of some unknown living creature. It moaned and cried like no voice
they had ever heard before. Yet it was strangely human. The crying of that
fleeing, bewildered <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_127'></a>127</span> apparition was silent now, and there seemed a note
of gloomy solace in the low, plaintive strain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ahead,&#8221; said Roy resolutely, &#8220;follow me. Not scared,
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He ascended the narrow, metal ladder of the windmill, Warde following. Upon
the top was a tiny platform, and here he turned on his flashlight. Crouched in a
heap was their friend Blythe. He was in a state of frantic agitation, his whole
form trembling like a leaf. His head was bowed; he clutched something in his two
hands. From it dangled a cord. Several burned matches lay near him and wisps and
little masses of woven straw littered the miniature aerial platform.</p>

<p>Roy turned his light above to that part of the superstructure which revolved
with the wind, enabling the winged wheel to keep in favorable position for
revolving. The moaning voice was very near now, within arm&#8217;s reach almost,
and at that close range was divested of its ghostly suggestiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Roy whispered, directing his light upward. There upon the
movable framework was something that looked like a cigar-box. It was <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> so placed as always to
catch the breeze from the revolving fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what it is,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;hold this light while I
take it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to know that there was no peace for that distracted, crouching
figure, as long as the weird voice from that compact little mechanism was
audible. He stood upon the framework and, reaching up, dislodged the harmless
box. A last dying wail accompanied his act. Then the big winged fan revolved
silently above them in the dark night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blythey,&#8221; cried Roy gently; &#8220;look up. It&#8217;s just
Warde and me. What&#8217;s the matter? Tell us, can&#8217;t you? What&#8217;s
the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got her&#8211;I can see her&#8211;she called
me&#8211;&#8221; was all Blythe could say. &#8220;Did you hear her
call&#8211;loud? I knew&#8211;I came&#8211;no&#8211;<i>no!</i>&#8221; he fairly
screamed, as Warde tried to lift his head and discover what he held. &#8220;I
came back&#8211;back to life&#8211;I was dead&#8211;you would have buried
me&#8211;can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m
alive&#8211;you&#8211;scouts&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>His head shook, he clutched at his breast, the hand which Roy tried to grasp
trembled and was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
like ice. The two scouts saw that there was no use talking with him. The
wretched creature was out of his senses. Huddling in a posture of abject terror
he clutched the object which he held tighter against his breast, his head bowed
and shaking, his whole form in convulsion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where you are, Blythey?&#8221; Warde asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the lower field&#8211;where they&#8217;re making hay,&#8221; Blythe
answered.</p>

<p>They tried no more at questioning him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want you to come with us, Blythey,&#8221; Roy said. His voice was
friendly, kindly, albeit he was himself disturbed and fearful. For neither of
the boys knew what this pathetic, demon-haunted creature might do next.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re your friends,&#8221; Warde added. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
get up and come with us&#8211;and go to bed. Don&#8217;t you remember all about
camp-fire, and Pee-wee, and all the fun we had? There isn&#8217;t any voice now,
it&#8217;s gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for all their kindness and resolve to help him, they felt certain qualms,
both of conscience and of fear. The all too conclusive proof that he was a
fugitive and that his hands and disordered <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_130'></a>130</span> brain were red with blood were strengthened by this
uncanny adventure.</p>

<p>To them the vision that he had seen, the voice that had lured him and brought
him to this pitiful state were the face and voice of his victim&#8211;a woman.
He had seen her, as such wretched, remorseful creatures ever do....</p>

<p>The big fan revolving silently above them in the brisk wind seemed almost to
bespeak a kind of quiet satisfaction that it had brought his crime back home to
him, and laid him low there upon that ghostly tower.</p>

<p>It was not without a feeling of relief that the two scouts heard the cheering
voices of their comrades approaching through the darkness. They had been
aroused, no doubt, by the piercing scream of Blythe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;you stay up here,
don&#8217;t leave him alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the foot of the ladder the leader of the Silver Foxes waited for the
members of the troop. It was good to see them approach. In the darkness he could
just distinguish their hurriedly donned and incomplete raiment. He saw their
looks of fear and inquiry, saw the almost panic <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_131'></a>131</span> agitation in Pee-wee&#8217;s round face and sleepy
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Roy said, trying to control his jerky,
nervous speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Warde?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shh, he&#8217;s all right&#8211;Blythe&#8211;Blythe is up
there&#8211;he&#8217;s in a kind of fit&#8211;he&#8217;s crazy&#8211;he&#8217;s
the&#8211;he&#8217;s the one, all right&#8211;he&#8217;s Darrell&#8211;shh,
<i>wait</i>&#8211;don&#8217;t go up. Do you see this? It&#8217;s one of those
banshees Harry Donnelle told us about&#8211;the kind the soldiers used to put up
in the windmills in Flanders. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s been making the noise.
It sort of&#8211;you know&#8211;spoke to him&#8211;that&#8217;s what I
think....&#8221;</p>

<p>If Roy had remembered some of the sprightly tales which their friend
Lieutenant Donnelle had brought from France, he might have saved himself and his
companion much fearful perplexity on that dark momentous night.</p>

<p>Or if they had ever been in Holland or Flanders they might have known of
those novel toys, the handiwork of ingenious youngsters, that moan and wail and
even pour forth their uncanny laughter when strategically placed on the tops of
windmills. American soldier boys, chafing under enforced idleness in trenches
and dugouts, would often <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_132'></a>132</span> beguile their time making these miniature calliopes
to catch the wind. And it is not out of reason to surmise that many a warrior in
the war-torn regions was startled and confounded by the aerial lamentations of
these harmless little boxes of wires and crude whistles.</p>

<p>A cigar box, a few strips of wire, and some odds and ends of willow wood
suffice for the manufacture of the Flanders banshee. There is now an American
banshee with all modern improvements (patent not applied for) invented and
controlled by Pee-wee Harris. But that is not a part of the present story.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AFTER THE STORM</span></h2>

<p>The expected difficulty of getting Blythe down from his strange refuge was
much simplified by his own demeanor. When his agitation subsided he became as
docile as a lamb, seeming quite willing to place himself in the scouts&#8217;
hands. He seemed utterly exhausted and bewildered. With this exception he showed
no trace of what he had been through, and appeared not to remember it.</p>

<p>When they asked him to get up, he stared at Roy&#8217;s flashlight for a
moment as if puzzled, then rose saying not a word. In the glare of the light one
of the scouts lifted a small locket that dangled on a cord around Blythe&#8217;s
neck, and several of the boys looked at it. Blythe either did not know what they
did, or he did not care. At all events he did not object. This seemed odd to
them considering how he had clutched the thing before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>They saw that it
was quite useless to question him about the matches and the wisps of straw or
about why the sounds had meant anything to him. They wondered whether indeed
that ghostly calling had aroused anything in his crippled memory or whether its
significance was only in his disordered mind.</p>

<p>They got him down the ladder and he accompanied them meekly to their little
camp, hanging his head, and never speaking. Westy Martin, who clasped his arm,
noticed that it still trembled, but otherwise he gave no sign of his
hallucination and insane agitation. They pitied him, of course, but they could
not repress a certain repugnance to him. Rational or not, a murderer is not a
pleasant thing.... Their hearty liking for him, which had grown into a kind of
affection, passed now to a feeling of pity.</p>

<p>Before they reached the camp he made the one remark which broke his otherwise
meek silence. On passing the shack on which they had last been working, he said,
&#8220;That&#8217;s where I found the robin, under that floor. Hollender thought
I would kill it. He thinks I&#8217;m that kind.&#8221; Then he laughed. Warde
said nothing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>They got him
back to his couch, where he almost immediately fell sound asleep. After ten
minutes or so, when Roy entered to look at his bare heel in the brightness of
his flashlight, he was breathing heavily, wrapped in the sleep of utter
exhaustion and oblivion. The diagonal mark seen in his foot imprint was plainly
noticeable as a scar on his heel. Doc Carson felt his pulse and it was almost
normal.</p>

<p>There seemed no likelihood of his trying to escape that night. His composure,
they thought, might have been intended to throw them off their guard; but his
deep, sonorous sleep rang true; it was as good as a cordon of sentinels. But for
the scouts there was yet no sleep and they raked together a few chips from the
scene of their former happiness and sat about the poor disconsolate little blaze
talking in undertones, trying to decide what they had better do. Of one thing
they were resolved, and that was that the county authorities in Bridgeboro
should be informed that this Blythe was none other than Claude Darrell....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WARNING</span></h2>

<p>They talked late and their decision before turning in was that the three
patrol leaders, Roy, Connie Bennett and Arthur Van Arlen should go to Bridgeboro
late in the afternoon and tell their scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth, of their
discovery. They chose the emissaries with the intention of putting the
responsibility upon their leaders where it belonged, and also with the thought
of having the three patrols participate equally in what seemed an odious thing,
view it as they would.</p>

<p>Pee-wee voiced the general sentiment when he said, &#8220;Gee, something is
all the time happening to prove he&#8217;s the one they&#8217;re after, and then
all of a sudden something happens so as to kind of make us like him and trust
him more. Anyway, I think he didn&#8217;t know what he was doing, and I like him
and I&#8217;m not afraid to say so.&#8221; And he added, &#8220;The Silver Foxes
are crazy if it comes to that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_137'></a>137</span>&#8220;They&#8217;re crazy about you, Kid,&#8221;
Roy said in forced good humor and ruffling his hair for him.</p>

<p>In the morning, to their utter astonishment, Blythe arose as usual, gathered
chips for the breakfast fire, and sat among them, drinking his coffee, and
eating the bacon which Roy had cooked, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>He seemed to expect the usual entertainment of wit and wisdom from Roy and
Pee-wee, and he smiled in his old way when Roy said with a poor attempt at
mirth, &#8220;Let&#8217;s finish up the egg powder, we&#8217;ll all scramble for
scrambled eggs.&#8221; Blythe heard only the pleasantry, but to the others the
reminder that it was their last breakfast there was cheering.</p>

<p>Altogether they were not at all satisfied with themselves though they knew
that what they were going to do was nothing less than their plain duty. Their
new friendship, their fine plans of a helpful turn, bringing pleasure and
profit, had ended in a sordid mess. Duties are funny things....</p>

<p>They had no heart for work that morning, but it was easier to work than to do
nothing. The three messengers wished not to go to Bridgeboro <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span> until afternoon because
their scoutmaster would be there then. They would feel easier and less
contemptible telling this thing to him than to the authorities.</p>

<p>After breakfast Blythe was the first at work. His energy was never equal to
his willingness, but on this morning, perhaps because the others seemed
half-hearted, he was up on the roof of the third shack ripping off boards before
they were well started. Others followed him up working at the edge of the roof.
Roy began lifting and hauling away the loosened floorboards below. Most of the
troop busied themselves clearing up the site of the second shack. The work
proceeded silently, almost gloomily.</p>

<p>The work had been going on in this way for about an hour when one of the
scouts working down at the edge of the roof called to Blythe who was up at the
peak that the roof beneath him was sagging.</p>

<p>The fact was that the uprights within the shack had been too soon removed,
which put a strain upon the all too slender horizontal timber which they had
supported. This had been pieced mid-way, an instance of hasty and flimsy
construction, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span> and
the weight of Blythe at this point caused the strip to sag.</p>

<p>The slanting timbers which formed the framework of the roof, running from the
peak down to the sides, were being dislodged at their lower ends by the scouts,
which operation, of course, withdrew their support from the horizontal beam on
which Blythe was working. He acknowledged the warning by springing the beam with
his weight, at which an ominous sound of straining and splitting was heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out up there,&#8221; Roy called from below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get off there Blythey they&#8211;<i>quick!</i>&#8221; another
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Climb down here,&#8221; another suggested.</p>

<p>Perhaps Blythe did not think as quickly as others think. Perhaps he did not
value his poor life as others value their lives. Who shall say? In any case he
did not descend by one of the slanting strips. In another moment the timber
under him was splitting and giving way at the cleated join, and sagging
threateningly. Then came the loud sound of final splitting and breaking away,
and a deep sagging preceding the complete break.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>A few brief
seconds remained for Blythe to decide what he should do. He might still descend
to safety as his companions had suggested. The increasing sound of splitting,
and the sagging, warned him to quick decision. Instead of moving he looked
directly beneath him where Roy was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he called down.</p>

<p>&#8220;My foot is caught under the flooring,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>A ripping and rending, and then the buckling of the broken pieces of timber
followed. The whole flimsy structure on which Blythe clung trembling in
air....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOOD TURN</span></h2>

<p>What happened then, happened like a flash of lightning. For a brief second
they saw Blythe hanging from the collapsing structure. Then they saw him let go.
Perhaps they did not know the full significance of Roy&#8217;s predicament. They
thought Blythe stark mad.</p>

<p>He struck the flooring with a thud, drew his breath and grabbed his ankle in
a sudden twinge of pain, stood, fell again with an exclamation of agony, then
dragged himself to his hands and knees, and pulled Roy to the ground. Bracing
his own back above the prostrate form he waited, the cords standing out on his
arms like ropes. He gulped and jerked his head as if to shake away the agony
that seemed killing him. His body was well clear of the small form beneath him.
And thus he waited, one second, two seconds,&#8211;</p>

<p>And then with an appalling sound of splitting <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span> timbers the whole structure collapsed
and fell upon him.</p>

<p>So suddenly did this happen that Blythe had scarcely braced himself over
Roy&#8217;s body when both were buried under the fallen debris. Nor had the
scouts at the edge of the roof wholly escaped; several who had not jumped
quickly enough and far enough received slight cuts and bruises from the falling
timbers.</p>

<p>Scrambling to their feet they called to the victims who were pinned unseen
beneath the wreckage, starting at the same time to haul away the debris. There
was no answer from beneath.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do? What did he do it for?&#8221; one asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Roy get from under?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search me; hurry up, pull the stuff off them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blythe is crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t think fast enough; he&#8217;s not to blame. Hurry
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy was crazy, you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>They worked frantically pulling away the fallen boards and beams, Grove
Bronson with a handkerchief wound around his bleeding hand, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span> Wig Weigand with a great bruise on his
forehead. Pee-wee strove like a giant. Soon the form of Blythe was revealed,
braced by his hands and knees, and Roy lying prostrate beneath him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you?&#8221; one of the scouts called.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Roy answered; &#8220;my foot is caught under the
flooring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blythe all right? How about you, Blythey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blythe did not answer. He seemed immovable, like a figure of stone. His bare
arms gave the impression of a taut rope. A heavy timber which they lifted from
across his back, where it had lain like a seesaw, must have all but broken his
spine. A rusted nail in it had torn his poor, shabby coat almost in twain, and
there was blood on the flannel shirt beneath it. Blood was flowing freely from a
wound in his head and dripping down from his neck like water off a roof.</p>

<p>They turned back his coat collar to see if there might be a cut on his neck
and there, confronting them, was the little cloth label containing the name of
the clothing store in Quebec. It shocked the scouts to see that in the very
moment of their friend&#8217;s supreme heroism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>&#8220;Blythe?
Are you all right? Speak? Stand up, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He neither moved nor spoke. He seemed transformed into an iron brace. Across
the calves of his legs lay a heavy timber, which had cut his trousers and which
must almost have crushed his legs when it fell. As they lifted it blood trickled
away. They noticed that he moved both feet spasmodically as if they had been
asleep. There could have been no circulation there, for the timber across his
legs had acted like a great tourniquet.</p>

<p>He remained immovable, silent, until the scouts had released Roy&#8217;s foot
and helped him out from under that human roof. That roof, at least, had not
collapsed. Bruised and bleeding as Blythe was, he remained in his attitude of
Herculean resistance as if he had died and become petrified there.</p>

<p>Then he spoke, his voice weak but tense, &#8220;Is he all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; said Roy; &#8220;how about
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blythe did not answer. He drew himself to his feet, reeled, clutched at Westy
who stood <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span> nearest,
and fell to the ground insensible.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Warde Hollister noticed something, and without speaking
indicated it to one or two others. It was a trifling coincidence and held his
glance and thought for but a second. On an end of fallen beam which protruded
from the wreckage sat a robin with head cocked sideways watching the stricken,
unconscious hero.</p>

<p>It seemed odd that right in that minute of his heroic abandonment, his
companions should be reminded of his villainy and of his gentleness....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>MR. FERRETT&#8217;S TRIUMPH</span></h2>

<p>Roy&#8217;s injury was but a strained ankle. For a moment he seemed dazed and
unable to realize what had happened. That the whole collapsed roof had been held
above him by superhuman effort of Blythe only dawned on him when he saw the
bleeding, unconscious form of his friend lying clear of the wreckage, Doc Carson
kneeling by him, the others standing silently about. It did occur to Roy, as odd
thoughts do come in tense moments, how pleased and content Blythe would be could
he but know that &#8220;Doctor Cawson&#8221; was in attendance. His faith in
scout first aid was so great, so flattering....</p>

<p>They made sure that his back was not broken and that his heart action was not
dangerously weak. Doc bathed the streaked hair and sterilized the cut which he
thought was not necessarily mortal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone will have to get a doctor,&#8221; he said. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span> He seemed the calmest
one present. &#8220;Hustle to Dumont or Haworth, one of you, and get to a
&#8217;phone. If you can find a doctor send him, but anyway call up Bridgeboro;
call up the hospital and tell them someone is hurt up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy was starting but Artie Van Arlen pulled him back. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
you can do to limp,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a hospital emergency call, the police will come,&#8221;
Westy warned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Doc, &#8220;get to a &#8217;phone,
that&#8217;s all I care about. And hustle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking Artie was gone. Several of them watched his
fleeting form, moving with steady, easy speed down the smooth white road. The
patter of his shoes sounded farther and farther off until the sound died
altogether, and the hurrying figure grew smaller and smaller as if it were going
down the scale from patrol leader to tenderfoot. They saw his hat blow off and
that he did not pause to recover it. Then he passed between the old gateposts
where the sentinels had once stood, and disappeared in a turn of the road. There
were houses a little beyond that point.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>Under
Doc&#8217;s direction the scouts worked three boards under Blythe&#8217;s own
balsam couch and carried this to where he lay. They got him onto it and bore it
gently into the camping shack, out of the glaring sunlight. There, in
Blythe&#8217;s Bunk, the only home he knew, they laid him gently down and at
Doc&#8217;s request those who were not needed went out. The victim lay quite
unconscious, his face ghastly pale and with a look of being polished caused
perhaps by the water which Doc Carson kept applying.</p>

<p>The wet, matted hair, too, gave him a ghastly, unhuman look. But Doc said
that his pulse was fair and that the blood was not flowing too profusely. That
was all he would say. With the true spirit of one who ministers he seemed to
have forgotten all else except that Blythe was stricken.</p>

<p>Outside the air seemed tense, the scouts standing about in little groups,
waiting. Their suspense was shown in the occasional glances which they gave up
the road. They spoke in undertones, their talk was forced and charged with
nervous tension. A kind of foreboding dwelt among them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll find out everything now,&#8221;
one said. &#8220;Should we maybe hide his coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no right to do that,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of our hands now,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>Then spoke Pee-wee Harris out of his staunch, sturdy little heart, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care&#8211;I don&#8217;t care what you say&#8211;he didn&#8217;t do
it. Lots of people look like other people. Because anyway I know he didn&#8217;t
do it. Remember about that robin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the label, Kid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pee-wee had not time to answer this poser for along the road came the
ambulance, pell-mell. Surely, the boys thought, Artie could not have spoken of
Blythe&#8217;s identity over the &#8217;phone, yet following the ambulance came
the touring car of Bridgeboro&#8217;s police department with the chief in it,
the policeman chauffeur, a couple of other men, and county detective Ferrett. A
couple of other cars, too, came lagging behind, in deference to the speed laws,
doubtless lured thither by the sonorous gong of the ambulance and the imposing
official display.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Artie came along scout pace. The scene of the pleasant little
scout camp was presently overrun by aimless sojourners in private <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span> cars, who gathered about
awaiting the actions of the high and mighty.</p>

<p>The surgeon in spotless white examined Blythe and said little. When one of
the scouts ventured to ask him if the injuries would prove fatal he said,
&#8220;Not necessarily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this fellow anyway?&#8221; the Bridgeboro chief asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fellow that&#8217;s hurt,&#8221; Doc Carson answered
rather dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belong around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was working here and we were helping him,&#8221; Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blythe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you boys know about this chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one answered this question. The boys felt nervous, uncertain what to say.
The one person present who was quite oblivious to all this official nonsense at
such a time was the one whom it most concerned, Blythe. He lay stark upon his
balsam couch with the blessing of unconsciousness upon him. The surgeon, with a
few words and much quiet show of efficiency, knelt by him, heedless of these
official busybodies. What hint <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_151'></a>151</span> he had of possible crime none could say. But they
were like vultures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the fire department?&#8221; Warde Hollister ventured to
ask a brother scout.</p>

<p>At this point the surgeon with gentle deftness removed the victim&#8217;s
faded, threadbare coat, and threw it upon the ground. With the promptness of
sudden discovery county detective Ferrett picked it up. He held it
distastefully, as one holds a thing infected. To the boys his act seemed like an
insult to the poor worn rag with its tear, caused by the falling beam, and its
brown bloodstain. But none of them spoke. Roy, in particular, watched the
official with keen interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominion&#8211;Dominion Clothing Company,&#8221; they heard him say;
&#8220;Quebec, Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed an awful pause. That would have been the time for the scouts
to speak. But none spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute,&#8221; they heard Mr. Ferrett say, just as two men
were about to lift the canvas stretcher which they had slipped under
Blythe&#8217;s body; &#8220;just a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a sort of huge wallet, and fumbling among its
multifarious contents <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_152'></a>152</span> pulled out an old faded paper, which he opened. Roy
and Westy, who stood nearest to him could read it plainly enough and see two
pictures, profile and front face, which it displayed:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>WANTED FOR MURDER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS</p>

<p>REWARD WILL BE PAID BY THE POLICE OF QUEBEC, CANADA, FOR INFORMATION LEADING
TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF CLAUDE DARRELL, ALIAS DARROW, ALIAS HICKY JOE,
ETC., ETC. WANTED FOR</p>

<p>BURGLARY AND HOMICIDE.</p>

<p>Was last seen in New York where he tried to enlist for military service. Hair
brown and straight. Complexion dark. Eyes gray. Height 5 feet 10-1/2 inches.
Weight about 140 pounds. Teeth white and even. May seek work as gasfitter. When
last seen wore a gray suit with double breasted vest. Walks slightly
sideways.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s our bird all right,&#8221; said Detective <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span> Ferrett with a cold
vulgarity which made the scouts&#8217; blood boil. &#8220;This is that Quebec
chap, wanted for murder. Here&#8217;s an easy five thousand. Look at this,
Chief; look at these pictures and then look at that face. O. K.? This is him or
I&#8217;m a dub. Just wait till I measure this chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort,&#8221; said the surgeon
briskly, and apparently not at all interested in Blythe&#8217;s history or
identity. &#8220;He&#8217;s not going to walk away. Just stand out of the way,
gentlemen, this is an ambulance call.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thrill of admiration passed through several of the scouts as they heard
this. &#8220;I&#8217;d&#8211;I&#8217;d&#8211;anyway I&#8217;d rather be a doctor
than a detective,&#8221; Pee-wee whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all down on the paper here,&#8221; said Detective
Ferrett. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got him dead to rights. Aim for a goose and you hit
a gander. This fellow&#8217;s a red-handed thug from Canada. They&#8217;ve had
the alarm out for him a couple of years. You kids never knew that, hey?&#8221;
And by way of a pleasantry he hit Roy a rap with his bulging wallet.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll measure him up down yonder. The face is enough, but these
specifications will clinch it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>&#8220;If
you&#8217;re after specifications,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;you might as well put
down that he&#8217;s got a scar on his left heel. It&#8217;s an old one, about
ten years old. And we&#8217;re glad you were the one to discover him and
you&#8217;re welcome to your old five thousand dollars. We don&#8217;t want it,
do we, Westy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the scene of all their good times and of their broken hopes was quiet
again, the ambulance and its attendant throng was gone, and the scouts were
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you hike home with your ankle like that?&#8221; Grove Bronson
asked Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, we can take our time. If we get home by evening it&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be moonlight here to-night&#8211;full moon,&#8221;
Westy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get the cooking things packed first,&#8221; Connie Bennett
said. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll clear up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might stay for one more camp-fire,&#8221; Hunt Ward suggested,
half-heartedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t seem the same,&#8221; Artie said.</p>

<p>They had all realized that. Dorry Benton laid aside the several tools that he
had gathered up and looked about as if wondering what to do next.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>&#8220;He saved
your life,&#8221; Will Dawson said to Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I don&#8217;t know that?&#8221; Roy replied, a little
catch in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe if you&#8211;sort of&#8211;you know, if you save a life, maybe
it makes up for taking one&#8211;&#8221; El Sawyer said. But it was plain that
he did not quite believe that.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Pee-wee said stoutly. &#8220;Do you
think I don&#8217;t know? I don&#8217;t care what&#8211;he didn&#8217;t do it.
He likes us an&#8211;and&#8211;I&#8211;I like him&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Kid, please don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say we were going to have two desserts that day I
stalked a hop-toad up at Temple Camp, and wasn&#8217;t I right?&#8221; Pee-wee
persisted. &#8220;So there. I can always tell. And if a fellow saved my life I
wouldn&#8217;t let anybody say he was a murderer, I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little brick, Kid,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A scout has got to be loyal, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Pee-wee shouted.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear you deny that. You can bet your life I wouldn&#8217;t
have any murderers saving my life. I don&#8217;t care about the Dominion
Clothing Company or anybody else. If you say <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_157'></a>157</span> he killed anybody, <i>he didn&#8217;t;</i>
that&#8217;s all I say. A scout has tuition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean intuition, Kid?&#8221; Westy laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about signs or anything,&#8221; Pee-wee stoutly
protested; &#8220;and I don&#8217;t care for detectives either. Do you think I
can&#8217;t tell a murderer? Everything can turn out to be something different,
can&#8217;t it? I can prove it by the movies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Warde Hollister stepped up to him and slapped his shoulder.
&#8220;You&#8217;re one bully little scout, Kid,&#8221; he said. Warde seemed
almost converted by Pee-wee&#8217;s inspiring, unreasoning loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I agree with you, Kid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And then
again&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with myself all the time,&#8221; Pee-wee said; &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t care who agrees with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing I&#8217;m glad of,&#8221; Westy said, &#8220;and that is
that somebody else gets the money; let them have all the credit, too. We had our
fun while it lasted,&#8221; he added wistfully. &#8220;And I&#8217;m glad Warde
didn&#8217;t count that trip for his first class badge. I&#8217;m glad we
don&#8217;t have anything to do with the bad side of it. It seems now just as if
a friend had died, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>&#8220;I kind of
hope he does die,&#8221; Grove Bronson said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just after being a hero,&#8221; Connie added.</p>

<p>This was too much for Roy. It brought poor Blythe&#8217;s heroism and his own
rescue home to him with vivid force, his eyes filled and everything about the
old familiar scene glistened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s get ready,&#8221; he finally said.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They could not share Pee-wee&#8217;s staunch conviction; they doubted whether
Pee-wee really did agree with himself in this matter. But they admired him none
the less for that.</p>

<p>Disconsolately they set about clearing up and gathering their belongings. It
seemed strange that one so quiet and unobtrusive as poor Blythe could be so
keenly missed. Now that he was gone they could see nothing but pathetic
reminders of him, the old grocery box he sat on at camp-fire, the box in which
he put old nails; above all, the windmill where he had suffered that
inexplicable brainstorm in the night. As for Roy, who owed his life to their
strange friend, he could not regain any measure of his former spirits, nor even
put a brave front to the disappointment <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_159'></a>159</span> as the others did. He limped about, silent and
crestfallen.</p>

<p>In the mid-afternoon they started on their hike back to Bridgeboro, a
cheerless group. Before going out between the old gateposts they turned for a
last glimpse of the scene of their pleasant camping and working adventure. Only
a few uprights of one shack remained. The accident had done the work of a day in
ten seconds. There was the charred area where their mighty fire had been. And
further off was the gaunt tower of the windmill, its big fan revolving slowly,
the only remaining thing suggestive of life in the desolated camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we could get the money for our work, maybe,&#8221; Westy
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any money,&#8221; said Hunt Ward of the Elks.
&#8220;All I want is to get back to our old car down by the river. We
don&#8217;t want any rewards and we don&#8217;t want any pay and we don&#8217;t
want any merits or rank badges or anything on account of being here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems kind of like a dream now,&#8221; Artie said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell how some dreams will come <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> out,&#8221; said Pee-wee. &#8220;Once I
had a dream that I was a murderer and when I woke up I found I wasn&#8217;t a
murderer at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one thing we like about you,&#8221; said Roy with a poor
attempt at his old bantering spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Pee-wee asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;re not a murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always said you were not,&#8221; Westy added.</p>

<p>&#8220;No friend of ours is a murderer,&#8221; Pee-wee said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to go back to raising mushrooms now,&#8221;
Will Dawson observed. &#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve got our old car
to go to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; said Vic Norris of the Elks.</p>

<p>They walked along for a little in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they hang him, I wonder?&#8221; Doc Carson asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been out of his head when he did it,&#8221; one
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was out of his head when he <i>didn&#8217;t</i> do it, you
mean,&#8221; insisted Pee-wee. &#8220;Do you think the Silver Foxes commit
murders just because they&#8217;re out of their heads? That&#8217;s no good of
an argument. Do you mean to tell me,&#8221; he shouted, turning suddenly upon
Roy; &#8220;do you mean to tell me <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_161'></a>161</span> that the fellow who saved your life like that would
kill people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just because I like you, that doesn&#8217;t prove that I&#8217;m out
of my head, does it?&#8221; Roy asked with a kind of wistful humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it does,&#8221; said Pee-wee, &#8220;because you say a friend of
yours kills people. If it wasn&#8217;t for him you wouldn&#8217;t be limping
now, so that proves the kind of a fellow he is. I don&#8217;t mean he made you
limp, but he made you stay alive so you could limp, and he doesn&#8217;t even
know that you thank him for it either&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Kid&#8211;&#8221; Roy began; he could hardly speak.
&#8220;I do&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; Pee-wee concluded. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell
you I was going to find that girl, and didn&#8217;t I find her? Didn&#8217;t I
send that letter? Didn&#8217;t I say that scout up at Temple Camp would get
well? Couldn&#8217;t I always tell when we were going to have apple dumplings?
And you go and believe an old picture and a lot of specific vacations or
whatever you call them. You&#8217;d better read Law Two in the handbook about
being loyal&#8211;you&#8217;re such a fine patrol leader&#8211;you act more like
a patrol wagon!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>&#8220;What do
you mean I can&#8217;t be loyal?&#8221; Roy demanded, his eyes glistening.
&#8220;The fellows&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about the troop,&#8221; Pee-wee interrupted.
&#8220;I&#8217;m talking about you and the fellow that saved your life.&#8221;
He paused in the road and stood facing Roy; a funny little round-faced figure he
was, with eyes blazing. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to say, is he a murderer or not?
You&#8217;ve got to say it. Yes or no? And these fellows&#8211;your own
patrol&#8211;they can prove what you say&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy was almost sobbing. Pee-wee certainly held the floor&#8211;or the
road.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men&#8211;Mr. Ferrett&#8211;they know better than we do, Kid.
Blythe is the one whose picture&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say yes or no,&#8221; Pee-wee demanded in a voice of thunder.
&#8220;They lifted him off where you were caught and so now you&#8217;re alive
and you can <i>speak</i>. Is he a murderer or isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy was going to pieces. The little scout whom he had always found it so easy
to jolly, towered over him. The tiny Raven was become a giant. &#8220;I&#8211;no
he&#8211;<i>no he isn&#8217;t</i>&#8211;he isn&#8217;t, Kid,&#8221; Roy
stammered.</p>

<p>Without another word Pee-wee hooked his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_163'></a>163</span> duffel bag to the end of his scout staff, after the
fashion of a Swiss peasant, and carrying the staff over his shoulder, marched on
ahead like a conquering hero, as if he preferred not to be seen hiking with such
people....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>HOME SWEET HOME</span></h2>

<p>The sturdy little scout did not long walk alone. Roy, visibly affected,
limped ahead, rapped him on the shoulder without saying a word, and hobbled
along at his side. And presently Warde Hollister, quiet, thoughtful, and always
somewhat a puzzle to the other scouts, joined them. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you,
Kiddo,&#8221; he said. Pee-wee did not appear to care who was with him and who
was not. His own stout little scout heart was with him, and that was enough.</p>

<p>And so these three who had taken the hike to Woodcliff, and discovered the
tell-tale notice, and mailed the formidable envelope to somebody or other, they
knew not whom, trudged along together now, and the resolute, loyal, unreasoning
spirit of Pee-wee Harris was like a contagion, giving the others hope where
indeed there seemed no hope, and diffusing something like cheer.</p>

<p>And noticing them, Westy said to Vic Norris <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_165'></a>165</span> of the Elks, &#8220;He&#8217;s a funny fellow,
Warde; it always seems as if he thinks more than he speaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never speaks till he&#8217;s sure,&#8221; Vic said.</p>

<p>The late afternoon sun was glinting up the river and bathing the patched roof
of their old ramshackle railroad car in flickering tints of gold, as they made
their way across the field to their quaint headquarters down by the shore in
Bridgeboro. The tide was full, the unsightly mud banks hidden; it seemed as if
their beloved familiar river had donned its best array to meet them. It rippled
against the grassy shore in a kind of song of welcome. The birds were busy in
the neighboring willow tree, and a fish flopped out of the glittering water as
if to remind them that some of the pleasures of vacation time were left to
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, old car!&#8221; said El Sawyer of the Ravens, as he tossed the
duffel bag through a broken window. &#8220;I hope we have enough in the treasury
to get that window put in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should worry,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of fun not having any money,&#8221; said
Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to have plenty of fun then,&#8221; said <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span> Westy. &#8220;This old car has got the
County Poorhouse turning green with envy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have a lot of fun in the poorhouse, they whittle things with
sticks,&#8221; Pee-wee said. &#8220;If you always have fun no matter what, that
shows you&#8217;re an optomotrist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean an optimist,&#8221; Doc Carson said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s leave our stuff here and go home,&#8221; said Connie.
&#8220;Then we can start in to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Off with the new love, on with the old,&#8221; said Artie.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no place like this old car,&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except Temple Camp,&#8221; two or three spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;And under Roy&#8217;s kitchen steps, that&#8217;s a good place,&#8221;
said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are anyway,&#8221; said Westy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here because we&#8217;re here,&#8221; said Roy with just a
glint of his wonted buoyant spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t deny that,&#8221; Pee-wee challenged.</p>

<p>There was no denying that, and the old patched-up car, relic of a bygone age
of railroading, seemed to breathe the atmosphere of home to them. Even the dusty
odor of its threadbare velvet seats seemed to welcome them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>They spent that
night in their homes; there was much to tell their parents. Several of them went
to see Mr. Ellsworth, and they were not disappointed to learn that he believed
the authorities were right, that Blythe was Claude Darrell. They had expected
this. The only scout who could draw his mighty sword against the scoutmaster and
the whole town was Pee-wee Harris, and he was at home and asleep. Mr. Ellsworth
praised his scouts for abandoning all thought of gain from their unhappy
adventure. &#8220;Just start all over again,&#8221; he said. So they resolved to
do that.</p>

<p>The next day county detective Ferrett took a hop, skip and a jump into fame.
Upon the front page of the Bridgeboro Evening Record was the following
headliner:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>MURDERER FOUND IN SCOUT CAMP. SENSATIONAL SEQUEL TO BOY SCOUT ENTERPRISE IN
OLD CAMP MERRITT.</p>

<p>Claude Darrell, a Canadian fugitive of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_168'></a>168</span>many aliases, was discovered yesterday by County
Detective Slicksby Ferrett in old Camp Merritt where he was found working with a
troop of local scouts, tearing down some of the old buildings of the wartime
concentration camp. Darrell is wanted in Quebec for burglary and murder.</p>

<p>His discovery and prompt identification by Detective Ferrett was due to an
alarm sent to Bridgeboro of an accident at the old camp.</p>

<p>The information being uncertain, local police officials and the county
officer accompanied the ambulance to the camp, where it was found that the young
man, who is a stranger to the scouts, had sustained injuries to his head and
body. The hospital officials say that he will recover.</p>

<p>His injuries were caused by the falling of a roof. The fellow was of a rough
appearance, his clothing in the last stages of shabbiness.</p>

<p>Detective Ferrett&#8217;s skill and long experience enabled him to judge at
once that the fellow was of the criminal class. He had <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>been palming himself off on the
youngsters as an unfortunate, out of work, and they had been helping him.</p>

<p>An inspection of his coat label and comparison of his face with a police
alarm picture which the detective had, enabled him to make the identification.
Owing to the almost emaciated condition of the fugitive and to his injury, it
has not been possible to verify the identification by measurements, but there
seems no doubt that he is the man wanted by the Canadian authorities.</p>

<p>These have been notified and Dominion detectives will visit Bridgeboro as
soon as the patient has fully regained consciousness and it is possible to
compel him to confront those who know him face to face.</p>

<p>Detective Ferrett, whose skill and shrewdness and remarkable memory enabled
him to bring this brutal criminal within the reach of justice, warns parents not
to let their children play in spots unfrequented by their elders, because of the
numerous thugs and desperate characters cast adrift by the war and the present
period of unemployment. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_170'></a>170</span>These, he says, are usually to be found on the
outskirts of small towns. Many of them come from New York. They pretend to be
fond of camping and so lure and then rob their adventure loving victims....</p>
</div><!-- block quote -->

<p>There was considerable more of this nonsensical twaddle. It was the silly
custom of the Bridgeboro Record to make heroes of the town and county officials,
and soberly to print the rubbish which they uttered for the pleasure of seeing
their names in print.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you beat that?&#8221; Westy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Outskirts of towns!&#8221; said Dorry. &#8220;Why we met him in
Bennett&#8217;s Candy Store!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He calls us children,&#8221; said Pee-wee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you speak of it,&#8221; said Warde Hollister, &#8220;it seems
funny that he should have gone right into stores in Bridgeboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parents should be warned against letting their children go into candy
stores,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>The next day it appeared that the doctors of Bridgeboro were not quite equal
to coping with poor Blythe&#8217;s case, and the Bridgeboro Record stated that a
specialist from New York had been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_171'></a>171</span> summoned to determine whether the desperate
scoundrel was feigning unconsciousness in order to baffle the authorities. It
appeared that not only thugs and bandits, but occasionally a surgeon who knew
his business, came from New York.</p>

<p>And then something happened....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A DISCOVERY</span></h2>

<p>The doctor from New York discovered something which the eagle eye of
Detective Ferrett had not discovered. And which the Bridgeboro doctors had not
discovered. It was nothing new. It was just two or three tiny cracks in the
skull of the fugitive criminal, not far from the rapidly healing cut which he
received in his deed of heroism. It might have been two or three years old, the
doctor said. He seemed keenly interested in it.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this, Detective Ferrett and a young doctor from the
hospital called at the homes of several of the older scouts and questioned them
about Blythe&#8217;s demeanor at camp. The boys had tried to tell the detective
of their companion&#8217;s peculiarities but he had not condescended to listen.
He listened now. And the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_173'></a>173</span> outcome of all this business was another article in
the Bridgeboro Record:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>CRIMINAL TENDENCIES CAUSED BY CRACKED SKULL?</p>

<p>A delicate operation was performed yesterday on the skull of Darrell, the
Canadian fugitive who is recovering from injuries in the Bridgeboro hospital.
The shaving of the hair from his head for the purpose of dressing a slight wound
received on the day of his capture was the means of revealing a small damage to
the skull, evidently caused by a previous accident. It was found that the
crushed area of bone caused a depression deep enough to press upon the brain
which might account for his mental state which is said to be abnormal.</p>

<p>Darrell has been subject to occasional fits of depression and is said to have
become easily excited. The present indications are that the operation was
successful. The patient is resting easily and talks more rationally than at any
time since his capture. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_174'></a>174</span>A police guard is being kept at his bedside and it
is the intention of the authorities to question him when he is able to submit to
such examination.</p>

<p>County Detective Ferrett, whose skill is responsible for the capture of
Darrell where he was in hiding at Camp Merritt, thinks that the damage to his
skull may very likely have been caused by a blow received in an altercation at
the time he killed his victim.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p>And so a few days elapsed, and the poor helpless victim was surrounded by
officials enough, both local and Canadian, to capture the whole hospital. But
the victim, pale and swathed and bandaged, had the advantage of them, and they
could only wait. Old Mother Nature cannot be hurried by the law. Much of the
time Blythe slept. Then, one fine day, he asked for Roy and Pee-wee. They asked
him what he wanted of Roy and Pee-wee and he said he wanted to hear them jolly
each other....</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VISIT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I guess we ought to have a rehearsal, hey?&#8221; laughed Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need any rehearsal,&#8221; said Pee-wee; &#8220;when we
get there you just start jollying me and I&#8217;ll answer you back. I
don&#8217;t care what you say, you can say anything you want. I&#8217;ll say a
lot of things about the Silver Foxes, hey? And you knock the Ravens; knock them
good and hard, I don&#8217;t care. Call me a raving Raven because that always
made him laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; Roy said, &#8220;he only has to look at you
to laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I wear all my stuff so you can make fun of me?&#8221; Pee-wee
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a heart,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;you don&#8217;t want to kill
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Warde to go too,&#8221; said Pee-wee, &#8220;because
he&#8211;I kind of think he doesn&#8217;t believe <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span> Blythe is a criminal. Maybe the others
think so, but he doesn&#8217;t&#8211;that&#8217;s what I think. And you
don&#8217;t because you said so.&#8221; Then he added anxiously, &#8220;Do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I guess not, Kid,&#8221; Roy answered doubtfully. He was
almost ashamed to say this, seeing the sturdy little champion at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get Warde,&#8221; Pee-wee said, &#8220;because he likes
Warde, and Warde&#8217;s pretty good at jollying me, too. And that&#8217;ll be
good because we&#8217;re the three that stick up for Blythe, hey? And if any of
those men say anything there&#8217;ll be three of us to answer them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t let us stay long, Kid,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, anyway we&#8217;ll see him; and I&#8217;m going to
tell him that the three of us know he&#8217;s innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t tell him that, Kid,&#8221; said Roy more thoughtfully.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s not speak about that. If he&#8217;s
innocent&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, <i>if?</i>&#8221; Pee-wee asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean it looks bad for him, Kid,&#8221; said Roy frankly. &#8220;If
his brain wasn&#8217;t just right, then it wasn&#8217;t so bad. See? He&#8217;s
the one that did it, you saw the pictures, Kid, and the label on <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span> his coat. But if he
didn&#8217;t know all about what he was doing then it wasn&#8217;t so bad. The
grown people know best, Kid. But that isn&#8217;t saying we can&#8217;t be
friends with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go back on what you said?&#8221; Pee-wee demanded grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, Kid,&#8221; Roy answered, nettled and annoyed;
&#8220;let&#8217;s not talk about it. We&#8217;re going to see him anyway. Come
on, let&#8217;s get Warde, that&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word Pee-wee turned up the next corner toward his home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going, Kid?&#8221; Roy called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said Pee-wee, never turning, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
there. I know the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy watched the sturdy little figure trudging along the side street. He knew
that Pee-wee was both angry and disgusted; he could tell by his walk. But the
Raven mascot was not too preoccupied with his mighty wrath to forget to tip his
scout hat to a lady whom he passed. He observed all the scout laws and rules.
There were no two ways about anything with Pee-wee. Loyalty meant more than just
friendship. It meant confidence, faith.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>This staunchness
somewhat daunted Roy. It made him feel not quite sure of himself; a little
ashamed. But after all it was just Pee-wee&#8217;s way; his faith was so strong
that he shut his eyes to facts.</p>

<p>Roy went down to the river and got Warde and together they started for the
hospital. Warde was glad to go. He said little, for that was his habit. He was
quiet and thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;That kid almost has me thinking that everybody&#8217;s
mistaken,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s so dead sure about everything. Don&#8217;t you suppose
I can be grateful to Blythe even if he&#8211;even if he&#8217;s
crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean even if he committed a murder if that&#8217;s the way you
want to put it. He did, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably he was crazy when he did it.... Wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the hospital they were shown into the public ward at the door of which sat
a policeman. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span> That
was to show that Blythe was under arrest. He was likely to escape! He lay upon
his cot, his head swathed in bandages, his eyes hollow, his face white. He moved
his eyes and smiled at the scouts without moving his head. It was the same old
smile, simple and companionable, as if he were of their own age and one of them.
All in a rush it took them back to old Camp Merritt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Cawson,&#8221; he said, just above a whisper. &#8220;Did he
come too? He&#8217;d like to see me now, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t come, boss,&#8221; said Warde; &#8220;but
Pee-wee&#8217;s coming. I guess he stopped to do a good turn. Better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weak yet,&#8221; their friend said, reaching a white hand out, which
each of the boys shook gently. &#8220;Your foot all right?&#8221; he asked
Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, only I can&#8217;t run yet,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;I should
worry. I&#8217;ve got to thank <i>you</i>, that&#8217;s one sure
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause; the scouts did not know what to say. They
wondered if their friend knew of the dreadful accusation. They felt that
whatever they said or did would be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_180'></a>180</span> wrong in that spotless, silent place, which was
subject to rules and customs that they did not understand. Finally, with furtive
glances at the nurses, they ventured to sit upon the edge of the cot. Then they
felt easier and more at home.</p>

<p>Despite his weakness and pallor and the appalling look which his bandages
gave him, there was something pleasant and wholesome in the victim&#8217;s look
which the scouts had not seen before. Stricken and helpless though he was, he
did not seem peculiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hurt my foot when I was a kid,&#8221; he said in a weak voice;
&#8220;I stepped on a scythe. I couldn&#8217;t walk for two months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your left foot?&#8221; Roy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My left heel, the scar&#8217;s there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>This was the first time that their queer friend had ever spoken of his early
life. He smiled again, that pleasant, companionable smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;tell us about it,&#8221; Roy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stepped on a scythe in the hayfield. I thought I told Doctor
Cawson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you never told him,&#8221; said Warde, gently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_181'></a>181</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; their friend
said.</p>

<p>There followed a pause. The victim lay quite still. The boys did not know
whether they should go or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how you found it out,&#8221; Blythe said. &#8220;It was when I
went up on the windmill, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was,&#8221; said Roy. &#8220;You were in your bare
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause. Blythe seemed meditating. The boys were
uncomfortable. Nurses came and went. One took the victim&#8217;s temperature. He
watched her as she went away. Finally he spoke.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span><a id='link_31'></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>HARK, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES!</span></h2>

<p>He spoke as if it were the most commonplace matter that he was telling,
&#8220;I told them that my brother tried to kill me and they don&#8217;t believe
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy looked at Warde, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t believe anything,&#8221; Blythe said, weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe you; tell us about it?&#8221; Warde said. &#8220;Did your
brother kill someone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he tried to kill me. Didn&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you never told us,&#8221; Warde said, gently. &#8220;Tell us
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was at Camp Merritt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? When?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blythe closed his eyes and lay for a few moments, silent. It seemed as if he
slept. The <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span> boys
looked at each other, puzzled. The invalid opened his eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you pick up all the sticks?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we did,&#8221; Warde said. &#8220;Tell us about your brother;
we&#8217;re all friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends and comrades,&#8221; Blythe said faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, you said it,&#8221; Roy assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tried to kill me,&#8221; Blythe said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he try to do that&#8211;Blythey?&#8221; Roy asked.
&#8220;We&#8217;re your friends; tell us all about it. You remember better than
you used to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I told you,&#8221; the invalid said simply.
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to take me to Canada next week. I&#8217;ve got to be
tried for something. They think I only dreamed that my brother tried to kill me.
I would rather stay here with you. Can&#8217;t you tell them, so I can stay
here? I want to stay. We were all like a kind of a family&#8211;telling yarns.
You know me. They have a conspiracy here. You know all about me, you tell them.
If you ask them to give me back the&#8211;the&#8211;locket, they will. It has
her picture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose picture&#8211;Blythey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s, <i>you</i> know. You know how I <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span> went up and got it.
You&#8217;re my friends and I&#8217;m yours&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are,&#8221; Roy said, his eyes glistening.</p>

<p>The invalid closed his eyes and lay as if asleep. The two scouts waited, but
the eyes did not reopen. So they arose quietly and left the ward. They had been
told they could not stay long. They were deeply affected and bewildered. Blythe
was different, but <i>how</i> different they could not say. He just seemed
different. He had spoken with simple frankness of things he had never mentioned
before. He was <i>changed</i>.</p>

<p>This fact and what he had said, and the stillness of the place, and the queer
odor in the ward and corridor, and the noiselessness of their own footfalls on
the rubber covered hall, awed the two scouts to such a degree that they longed
for the free open air where they could talk.</p>

<p>It was with some trepidation that they encountered at the head of the
stairway the police guard talking with Detective Ferrett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how do you find him?&#8221; the county official asked in gruff
good humor. He at least seemed not at all awed by the solemnity of the
place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>&#8220;Does he
have to go to Canada?&#8221; Roy asked. &#8220;Does he have to go
soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, siree. Been telling you about his brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; Roy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Na-a-h! He either hasn&#8217;t come to his senses yet or he&#8217;s
bluffing. He&#8217;s going back to Quebec to a dope-house or else to the
gallows. How&#8217;d <i>you</i> like to go to the gallows, hey?&#8221; he added
as a pleasantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re&#8211;you&#8217;re <i>sure</i> he&#8217;s the one?&#8221;
Roy asked, in pitiful despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now what do <i>you</i> think? You saw the pictures, huh?
He&#8217;s the chap, says you. Been trying to string you, huh? He rang that
brother in on me yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants the locket you took from him,&#8221; said Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, does he? Well, wouldn&#8217;t that be nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it helps him to get better and helps him&#8211;maybe&#8211;to
sleep&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, you run home and say you had a call on him, and look out who
you make friends with next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were just about to start down the stairs, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span> heavy-hearted with that last pathetic
memory of their friend to carry in their minds, when looking down the broad
stairway, they beheld a strange sight. A diminutive figure was ascending the
steps.</p>

<p>He wore the full scout regalia, including all sundries and accessories, and
the sight of him as he came trudging up carried the others back to that day when
they had taken their memorable hike to Woodcliff. For stuck under his belt like
some awful document of authority was an envelope of goodly dimensions, and his
countenance wore a look calculated to strike terror to the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>Thus ascended the doughty little knight of the Good Turn, and several nurses
watched him amusedly from the foot of the broad stair....</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a id='link_32'></a>CHAPTER XXXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>RETURN OF THE GOOD TURN</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re so smart,&#8221; said Pee-wee, including the
men as well as his scout comrades in his scathing rebuke. &#8220;It shows how
much you know about good turns and scout laws and things. Maybe you think
<i>I</i> haven&#8217;t got any<a id='FNanchor_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3'
class='fnanchor'><sup>[3]</sup></a> specific vacations. Here, read this letter
and look at the pictures. Then you better go home and read scout law Number Two.
Did you start jollying yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Roy drew a folded sheet from the envelope several pictures fell to the
floor. One of these was an unmounted cabinet photo, the others were
exceptionally good amateur prints. As County Detective Ferrett gathered these up
he scrutinized the photograph with sudden interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get this?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I got it,&#8221; said Pee-wee mysteriously. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span> &#8220;You&#8217;re a detective, you
ought to know specific vacations when you see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>County detective Ferrett was not one to be either polite or ceremonious where
his professional interests were concerned. He therefore snatched the letter from
Roy&#8217;s hands and proceeded to read it with eager interest.</p>

<p>It was only by crowding around him that the boys could read it. But in his
sudden interest in the letter the shrewd official had released the pictures to
their rightful owner and the eyes of Warde and Roy were riveted upon these in
speechless consternation.</p>

<p>One showed the very sweet face of a woman, and as the boys looked at this
they were conscious of having seen that face somewhere before. Two others showed
country scenes, including a house. They were the kind of scenes that amateur
photographers love to take; scenes with a homely familiarity about them&#8211;a
woman sitting in a rocking chair on a porch, a dog skilfully caught by the
camera in the moment of his resting his paws upon a fence, a back door with a
churn standing near. Commonplace things, the last subjects that an artist would
choose, but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span> scenes
that have a way of reaching the heart and recalling fond memories.</p>

<p>But out of the professionally taken photo there looked straight at the boys
eyes, oh, how familiar, how friendly, how companionable. And upon the mouth
hovered that little smile that they knew, oh, so well. It seemed, yes it seemed
that if Roy were to start jollying Pee-wee then and there, that smile would
broaden. It was the picture of Blythey, their friend. It seemed to say,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s start the camp-fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handwriting of the letter was small and shaky. The missive read:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p><i>Dear Unknown Friend:</i>&#8211;</p>

<p>The letter you sent me came to me. It was brought to me by the postmaster. In
the big town not so far from here there are boys in brown suits and they call
them scouts. A neighbor of mine says you must be one of those because they are
all over the country.</p>

<p>It is so kind how you thought to send the letter. I would like to know where
you got it. It made me very sad to read it because it was written to me by my
son Joe, who was killed <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_190'></a>190</span>in the war. He was killed near Reims. I wish I could
know all about it but nobody can find out for me.</p>

<p>He went from Camp Merritt in April 1918 and Mr. Hicks who is postmaster here
has a big map on the wall in his store and he says that Bridgeboro (which is
written near your name on the envelope) is near Camp Merritt, so perhaps you
found the letter. I guess so for it is so old and looks as if it had been in the
weather, but it is very, very dear to me. So, my dear young friend, who are so
kind, you can say to yourself that you made me see my boy once more just the
same as if he came back. I think that will make you happy. It made me sad but it
made me happy too. It seems as if I have a letter from both of you and I will
never see you but you are both with me in my trouble and loneliness.</p>

<p>I would like you to come here sometime and see the home where my boy grew up
but I have much trouble and fear that soon I must go to the Home in
Barnardsville, there to end my days. But these pictures taken by my boy will
show you his home that I must now lose and his dog now <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>twelve years old; poor dog, I do not
know where he will go when I go to the Home.</p>

<p>My dear boy saved his life when he was your age as I suppose, and do you know
how? By running to him when he was caught in a thrasher and my boy stepped on a
scythe as he ran and he was many weeks in bed while I nursed him. It seemed
hardest of all that I could not nurse him when he died. He was a brave boy and
so gentle and kind to me and to everyone, even the animals, and he was so noble
and good to me after his father died.</p>

<p>So you see, my dear young friend, I have lost much, even more than I tell you
and I say there are sorrows worse than death so you will be a pride and comfort
as you grow up, for I have known what an undutiful son is too. But I think of my
brave, noble boy that died in France and you brought him back to me for a few
minutes when I sat reading his letter. So I shall always love these scout boys
on account of you and would like to read about them but my eyes are not very
strong.</p>

<p>And now I say good-bye to you, my dear young <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_192'></a>192</span>friend and often I will think of you after I go to
the Home.</p> </div><!-- block quote -->

<p class='tar5'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Mary Haskell</span><br />Hicksville,
North Carolina.</p>

<p>The quiet of Hicksville, North Carolina, could have been no deeper than the
stillness which prevailed when the scouts finished reading this letter. They
seemed to feel that if they moved or spoke it would destroy a spell and prove
this whole amazing business a dream. Within the ward the voice of some patient
could be heard in petulant complaint. Nurses with silent tread, moved in and out
of the apartment. An auto horn could be heard tooting somewhere in the distance.
But Warde and Roy were in Hicksville, North Carolina.</p>

<p>Warde was the first to speak. Modest, as he always was, he now uttered a
thought which had lingered in his mind for many days. &#8220;Now I know why he
said &#8217;<i>Doctor Cawson</i>,&#8217;&#8221; he observed quietly. &#8220;He
belongs in the south. I know why he didn&#8217;t say <i>Tranto</i> and
<i>Monreal</i>; it was because he never lived in those places. But of course,
that doesn&#8217;t prove anything, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>&#8220;It proves
something about <i>you</i>,&#8221; said Roy proudly. Oh, he could afford to be
generous and happy!</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need any proof,&#8221; said Pee-wee;
&#8220;haven&#8217;t we got proof enough? What more do you want? Now what have
you all got to say? You&#8217;re so smart!&#8221;</p>

<p>No one had anything to say, not even Detective Ferrett. All he could do was
whistle perplexedly. The overworked, thin, trembling arm of poor Mrs. Haskell
had reached out and dealt him a knockout blow, under the exclusive auspices of
Pee-wee Harris, mascot of the raving Ravens, scout of the first class, master of
good turns, defender and exponent of good scout law Number Two, First
Bridgeboro, New Jersey, Troop, Boy Scouts of America!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span><a id='link_33'></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MYSTERY</span></h2>

<p>It was many days before all the bits of this strange puzzle were put together
and the full truth revealed. As the condition of the invalid improved his memory
returned to him. This wonderful effect of the operation on his skull was
noticeable first in the recollection of trifles and disconnected events in his
life. Usually he got these confused at first but each item in the marvelous
catalogue of the brain was finally put in its right place.</p>

<p>His piecing together the events of his life was like the gathering up of the
broken pieces of a bowl and the successful reconstruction of it by patiently
fitting in the fragments here and there. It was a marvel and a delight to the
scouts who visited him constantly, to watch him searching for things in the
darkness, as one might say, and bringing them home to patch together the broken
picture of his past.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>But how came
that injury, discovered by the merest chance, which had wrapped his early life
in a blackness like the blackness of night? Haskell never told of this
connectedly, for he could neither speak of it or think of it without becoming
greatly agitated. And that tragic occurrence was never made known to his aged
mother.</p>

<p>But these were the facts which were gradually brought into the light. Joe
Haskell and his brother had been twins. Long before their father died Bob
Haskell had done much to bring shame and worry to the veteran who had fought in
the confederate cause, and whose end was hastened by his dishonest, worthless
son.</p>

<p>Hicksville proved too small for this enterprising scamp who, after rifling
the cash drawer in the railroad station, withdrew from these scenes of limited
opportunity to spread his wings in the great metropolis of New York.</p>

<p>Joe and his mother never heard of him again. The stunted affections and
criminal tendencies of the one son seemed compensated for in the other, who
remained the dutiful and loving companion and support of his mother until the
great war called him. He received his training at a southern <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span> camp and was later
transferred to Camp Merritt, which was an embarkation camp. Had it not been for
a certain occurrence he would have sailed with the swarms of boys who went
across in the spring and summer of 1918. But he never went to France.</p>

<p>On a pleasant Sunday morning in April of that year, Joe Blythe started for
Woodcliff to dine at the home of a family he did not know&#8211;the home and
family of Miss Bates. As we know, he never reached that hospitable roof. We do
know, however, that in an isolated shack in the woods not far from camp were
found his wallet containing his leave of absence, an unmailed letter to his
mother, and Miss Bates&#8217; card.</p>

<p>How came he to that shack? It was in a bypath sometimes followed by soldiers,
he said. He said he paused there to get out of a shower. This statement was at
least partly verified by the authorities who secured reports that it did rain on
that day.</p>

<p>Joe Blythe said that in that shack he met his brother, shabby, desperate. Did
the brother know that Joe was a soldier in the camp? Very likely. Was he lying
in wait for him in that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_197'></a>197</span> secluded spot? That also seems probable. That his
brother attacked him, hitting him with an old sash-weight, is certain. Who shall
say what actually transpired between these brothers in that lonely spot?</p>

<p>But the proven facts of Bob Haskell&#8217;s career are these. He escaped from
Canada after committing burglary and a brutal murder. He tried at one American
recruiting station after another to find safety in military service, and was
rejected as unfit wherever he applied.</p>

<p>Neither Joe nor anyone else knows what was in the mind of this defective,
desperate, frantic wretch when he sought the neighborhood of Camp Merritt. No
one knows whether the horrible plan which he executed had been previously
conceived.</p>

<p>But this is certain, that he struck his brother on the head and laid him low
and took from him not only his uniform but his memory as well. One thing he did
not take, because he did not want it, and that was a little trinket containing
their mother&#8217;s picture which Joe had always worn.</p>

<p>We may picture Joe Haskell lying in that dank, musty shack, bleeding,
unconscious, for hours. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_198'></a>198</span> How long he lay there no man shall say. We may
picture him wandering forth, in an ill-fitting suit of civilian clothes,
demented, broken, dazed. Of his wanderings, likewise, who shall tell the full
truth? He visited a place called Blytheville and took the name of Blythe. He
visited great cities, so he said. He was in the west. He was in jail for
vagrancy. He watched some cows for a farmer. He remembered nothing of his past.
He was sheltered by the Salvation Army somewhere. He was a wanderer over the
country.</p>

<p>And so in time he wandered to New York. There he fell in with men who were
interested in demolishing the old camp. Probably they had no faith in him. They
did not reckon that he would fall in with a troop of scouts who, in the good
cause of pitying friendship, would make the old shacks of the deserted
reservation echo to the sound of their saws and hammers, and the music of their
merry laughter.</p>

<p>And the brother?</p>

<p>April in the terrible year of 1918 was the month of all months when troops
were sent abroad by the thousands, half equipped, untrained, as fast as the
speeding transports could <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_199'></a>199</span> carry them. It was a time of weakening hope, of
misgivings, of confusion and frantic hurry. Men, men, men, whether they were
soldiers or not, so only that they were men! Few know of the frenzied haste in
the embarkation camp those days. Few will ever realize how near the war came to
being lost.</p>

<p>For Bob Haskell there was no returning consciousness and only the silent
records of the War Department could speak for him, reporting his supreme
sacrifice under a name but a part of which was his own. That he lived in camp as
his brother for at least a few hours in that time of unquestioning rush and
inevitable disorder seems probable enough. That he fell in the fighting, under
the name of Joseph Haskell, we know.</p>

<p>So at least the uniform which he stole was not dishonored. And since he paid
for his crime with his own life, and in the way that he preferred, may we not
follow his brother&#8217;s good example and let his checkered memory rest in
peace? Joe never told his mother more than this, that it must have been his
brother who was killed in France. She never knew who struck him down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>Another episode
is not so easily explained, for it is bound up with Joe Haskell&#8217;s mental
condition while he was with the scouts. That is the episode of the windmill.
About that he seemed to remember but little. No doubt the calling of the voice
which he thought was his mother&#8217;s was a pure hallucination. It was like a
little flash of light in his darkness. Yet it might have been that the peculiar
sounds aroused certain memories.</p>

<p>One very strange fact, however, is certain, and that is that he did find the
trinket with his mother&#8217;s picture on that lonely, wind-swept tower. The
voice which had called him had not mocked and deceived him. How came that little
trinket there?</p>

<p>The only answer that we have to this question is the theory of Pee-wee
Harris, wearer of the stalking badge, and, as his very nickname shows, the
friend of birds. He claimed that a wren, or one of the mischievous, pilfering
birds of that group had carried the locket to its nest in the old windmill. It
is true that certain birds carry such glittering trifles to their nests and it
is well known that wrens forage in old buildings and often build in windmills.
There were a few <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
wisps of straw to give color to Pee-wee&#8217;s ingenious theory.</p>

<p>But when it comes to building, Pee-wee himself is a master builder of castles
in the air.</p>

<p>And there you are.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span><a id='link_34'></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>SEEIN&#8217; THINGS</span></h2>

<p>On a certain fair day in the autumn Joshua Hicks stood in the doorway of the
Hicksville post office and contemplated the chickens which were congregated on
the store platform waiting for the mail. He looked as if he had been standing
there uninterruptedly since we last saw him. His octagon-shaped spectacles were
exactly half way down his nose, and his nose was just as long as it was on the
day we made his acquaintance&#8211;if anything, a little longer. He was waiting
for the big daily event in Hicksville, the arrival of the train.</p>

<p>But a bigger event than that was to arouse Hicksville. When the train arrived
a solitary figure got out, a young man with a suitcase, who waved his hand
familiarly to Joshua and called, &#8220;Hello, Josh,&#8221; as he strode away up
the road.</p>

<p>For a minute Josh could only stare and say, &#8220;By gum.&#8221; Then he
took off his spectacles and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_203'></a>203</span> wiped them as if they were responsible for the
strange thing he had seen. But this, when he replaced them, only made the
hurrying figure stand out clearer to his vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marthy,&#8221; said he, re-entering the post office and addressing his
daughter, &#8220;I jes&#8217; seed a ghost; as sure as I&#8217;m standin&#8217;
here, Marthy, I seed the ghost of Joey Haskell. It got off the train jes&#8217;
as sure as I&#8217;m standin&#8217; here, Marthy, and called out ter me and went
up the road. I seed it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same as you seed the goblins in Hiram Berry&#8217;s cornfield before
prohibition,&#8221; said Marthy, who was not to be startled out of her rustic
calm by any of her father&#8217;s visions. And she continued sorting the mail
which consisted of a newspaper and two letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;If folks is dead and yer see &#8217;em, it&#8217;s sperits,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; Joshua demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If folks is dead they don&#8217;t come to Hicksville, I reckon,&#8221;
said the girl.</p>

<p>One might suppose that Hicksville would be just the very place folks would go
to, if they were dead. Be that as it may the young man was no ghost. He was just
a little pale, and he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span> looked as if he might have known much suffering,
but he was no ghost.</p>

<p>Up the little lane he went where goldenrod was blooming and where some of the
birds that had beaten him on the journey southward were flitting and chirping in
the trees. A little brook that bordered the narrow, fragrant way seemed hurrying
along at his side, laughing in its pebbly bed, as if to give him a welcome home.
Straight ahead he went till he came to the little white house. In the tiny front
window hung a small faded square of cloth which might once have been red, and in
the center of this was a crude homemade star of gold, but all the pristine
brightness had gone from it.</p>

<p>The young man opened the door, laid down his suitcase, stepped into the
little sitting room, and taking down the tattered, faded symbol called out,
&#8220;What&#8217;s this doing here? If that isn&#8217;t like Hicksville! The
war over two years and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the astonished and frightened face of a little, wizened old lady
appeared in the kitchen doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mother!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>Then in another
moment he was helping the trembling form to a chair and laughing and stroking
the gray hair and putting his arm around that thin, wrinkled neck.</p>

<p>It was almost too much for her. She looked at him with a kind of terror in
her poor old eyes, as if she thought he was not real, and she clung to him as if
she were drowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Muddy,&#8221; he laughed, kissing her and making
a fine joke of her bewilderment; &#8220;feel of me; here, pinch me. Ouch! See
how real I am? I&#8217;m hungry too, if anybody should ask you. I think
I&#8217;ll go up to Ruth Jillett&#8217;s house for supper&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She only clung to him tighter&#8211;and cried a little more. &#8220;You was
always thinking of Ruth first,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Joey, my eyes is not what
they wuz, I&#8217;ve seen you so much when I was alone here&#8211;in all the
trouble&#8211;you wouldn&#8217;t fool me&#8211;Joey?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer she got such a hug as no ghost could ever give. &#8220;Of course,
if you&#8217;d rather believe the Government than your own eyes.... Why
here&#8217;s Sport! Hello, Sport, I&#8217;ll leave it to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> you,&#8221; he added, reaching down and
patting the dog whose tail was going like a pendulum. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
woman that doesn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joey, you mustn&#8217;t say that&#8211;you&#8211;you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, old Muddy, then admit that I am me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand&#8211;I&#8211;Joey&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Another hug, &#8220;Of course, you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re just two years
out of date. You&#8217;ve been living among the dead and you think
everybody&#8217;s dead and I&#8217;m going to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to Ruth Jillett&#8217;s, Joey&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I certainly will if you don&#8217;t get me some supper. How
about that, Sport? Here I am come home a rich man with three hundred dollars in
my pocket, and no supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joey, if I had only known I&#8217;d have made a meat pie. I
won&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re real till I see you eat, Joey.&#8221; That
would be a good test.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t eat here many more times&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, we will. I&#8217;ve got three hundred dollars, and two hundred
of it belongs to some boy scouts. They made me take it as a loan. We&#8217;re
going to stay right here and I&#8217;m going to get a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span> job in Cartersburgh and I&#8217;m
coming home every night&#8211;so as to be near Ruth. Hey, Sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor old Mrs. Haskell only clung tighter to him. And Sport looked up, and
kept looking, as if he did not understand at all.</p>

<p>And so, as the evening drew on, these two, mother and son, sat in the little
kitchen of their old home and talked while Joe ate his supper; a very good
supper indeed for a &#8220;sperit.&#8221; And since it was a matter of eating,
may we not fancy that the staunch spirit of Pee-wee Harris of the raving Ravens
was with them as they talked late into the night? And when Joey Haskell jollied
his poor old mother (as he did most shamefully) may we not picture that
diminutive scout saying in high disgust, &#8220;You think you&#8217;re smart,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet, you know, you will hear it said that nothing ever happens in
Hicksville....</p>

<p><b>Roy Blakeley</b></p>

<p>In a book given by a kindly old gentleman, Pee-wee Harris discovers what he
believes to be a sinister looking memorandum, and he becomes convinced that the
old gentleman is a spy. But the laugh is on Pee-wee, as usual, for the donor of
the book turns out to be an author, and the suspicious memorandum is only a
literary mark. The author, however, is so pleased with the boys&#8217;
patriotism that he loans them his houseboat, in which they make the trip to
their beloved Temple Camp, which every boy who has read the TOM SLADE BOOKS will
be glad to see once more.</p>

<p><b>Roy Blakeley&#8217;s Adventures in Camp</b></p>

<p>Roy Blakeley and his patrol are found in this book once more happily
established in camp. Roy and his friends incur the wrath of a land owner, but
the doughty Pee-wee saves the situation and the wealthy landowner as well. The
boys wake up one morning to find Black Lake flooded far over its banks, and the
solving of this mystery furnishes some exciting reading.</p>

<p><b>Roy Blakeley, Pathfinder</b></p>

<p>Roy and his comrades, having come to Temple Camp by water, resolve to make
the journey home by foot. On the way they capture a leopard escaped from a
circus, which brings about an acquaintance with the strange people who belong to
the show. The boys are instrumental in solving a deep mystery, and finding one
who has long been missing.</p>

<p><b>Roy Blakeley&#8217;s Camp on Wheels</b></p>

<p>This is the story of a wild and roaming career of a ramshackle old railroad
car which has been given Roy and his companions for a troop meeting place. The
boys fall asleep in the car. In the night, and by a singular error of the
railroad people, the car is &#8220;taken up&#8221; by a freight train and is
carried westward, so that when the boys awake they find themselves in a country
altogether strange and new. The story tells of the many and exciting adventures
in this car.</p>

<p><b>Roy Blakeley&#8217;s Silver Fox Patrol</b></p>

<p>In the car which Roy Blakeley and his friends have for a meeting place is
discovered an old faded letter, dating from the Klondike gold days, and it
appears to intimate the location of certain bags of gold, buried by a train
robber. The quest for this treasure is made in an automobile and the strange
adventures on this trip constitute the story.</p>

and have a lively time doing it.</p>
